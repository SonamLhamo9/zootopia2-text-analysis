Summary:
Disney has so much technology to animate at their hands, and it continues to show that off with this film. Smooth movements, a colorful design, and plenty of character in the motions, Zootopia 2 is a gorgeous display of what is possible with their resources, giving the audience plenty to look, gawk, and enjoy as the multi-biome city returns once more to the big screens. Within this environmental playground is an adventure that feels a bit bigger and more explored than the previous film's montage did. We dive into a few more secrets and environmental factors, playing around with the fauna that is indigenous to them, adapting to the needs as the wild adventure unsheathes its claws. It goes more down the traditional Disney route to teach lessons, but not be so in your face like the first film, which opens up a bit more of an escape from the real world. And helping to keep things fun is comedy that is present in so many forms that it's hard not to find some style to have you cracking up in the theater. Kids are going to become infatuated with a lot of the silliness invoked, and many of the parents will probably get pulled into the fervor with them and making many Instagram/TikTok videos to mimic them. My favorite part had to be the references. Like Wish, Zootopia 2 is ready to poke fun at Disney's work, and you'll find references abound within the two hours as another collective ""cameo"" menagerie is integrated into the movie. Mostly comedic, sometimes emotional, these references serve as another angle to enjoy the film for a geek like me. All of this is done at a decent pace, an adventure to follow in a manner that doesn't feel slow, and relatively keeps things in check to not be extremely fast you have no content.

The movie, of course, has plenty of emotional aspects with the Disney magical touch. A heartfelt film that digs deep into some hot topics, the monologues are sweet, sincere, and relevant to the new age of viewers. Bringing that to life (alongside the comedy) is stellar voice acting from an assorted cast who know how to bring such heart into their animated characters. Goodwin is always a command of emotions, bringing happiness and sadness in this genuine form that adapts to every scene with such sharp precision. Bateman is Bateman. That's not a bad thing, but his character didn't require as much spread across the emotional range. But he knows how to enunciate and manipulate his words to make the puns come to life, the jabs feel fun, and he really commands the comedic element so well. As for Quan, I loved him as the snake, genuine, cute, and somehow managing to embody his usual self in that snake form. I loved his little tweaks and had hopes they would have done a bit more with the film. In most cases, the delivery brings the heart this film needs, and I feel many will soften to the wonderful work they gave us with this film's content and performances. And if that's not your beef, then Shakira's new song has got a bit more flair, fun, and utilization as this zoo is ready to show you what it contains.

DISLIKES:
The Predictability
Some Overkill On Comedy
Needed A Bit More Mystery/Suspense
A Bit Overkill With References
Missed Some Character Development
Summary:
Yet, the movie suffers from predictability, with many of the mysteries easily solvable within the first thirty minutes. Zootopia 2 is having so much fun that some of the stronger elements feel weaker in this film, diluted to be less intense for fear of being too much for the target audience. While I'm glad there was more adventure, I would have liked a little more magic, mystery, and suspense added to this to keep things on edge as to what would happen. Alas, I think Disney's focus on comedy and references may have gotten in the way of better storytelling. To put so much focus into these slapstick fests of clumsiness, goofy walking, and yammering by several characters into what will surely be a new trend, there just seems to be less focus on the older audience moments. Throw in that many side stories feel bland and pieced in, leading to too many subplots battling for relevancy, so that they seem to trip up each other to a small degree. And despite the hints of touching, the character development is surprisingly weaker than I had thought it would be. Don't get me wrong, there are still some elements that appear, but again, much of the sharing is a lot of references, comedic jabbering, and these shallower elements that I was surprised they pursued.

The VERDICT:
Zootopia 2 is very fun, endearing, and an adventure that returns to Disney's era, where the adventure was just as important as the messages. Beautiful animation and voice acting work together to bring our buddy cup duo back to life, and I loved how well these were all integrated to make the tale come to life. With lots of comedic elements, a good pace, and references to scope out each rewatch, it's a film that will cater to a lot of audience members, especially the younger generations. Where the movie fails is getting too lost in that fun, silliness, and multiple stories, so that the elements of the first film feel a bit flatter than I expected. Character development is not missing, but doesn't lack the same intensity, nor does the mystery/suspense that also feels like kiddy gloves were pulled on for writing the story. There was more to unlock, discover, and fight, but the new era of storytelling/censorship still is a bit more prominent, and it's holding back some of Disney's strongest elements. Still, in the long run, the movie is a theater-worthy adventure for many reasons, and I encourage you to head out and give it a look if you can. My scores for Zootopia are:
Mystery/Action/Adventure/Crime/Animated/Family: 8.0
Movie Overall: 7.0.",50,6,0.22689087848178752,0.9997,4
rw10983944,jared-25331,9.0,2025-11-28,They're back with a twisssst.,"Zootopia 2 (2025) is the highly anticipated and long awaited sequel to Zootopia (2016) and it follows Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde, who go undercover to pursue Zootopia's new and mysterious reptilian resident Gary De'Snake. I actually watched the first movie last week for the first time ever before this movie came out and I really enjoyed it and I can say the same for this movie because it was awesome.

Positives for Zootopia 2 (2025):
It was great to see these characters back on a mission to save the citizens of Zootopia from a new threat. Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman are still awesome as Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde respectively and their chemistry is just as good as it was in the first movie. I love the addition of Ke Huy Quan as Gary De'Snake and he has a great dynamic with our two lead and he got some great emotional and comedic moments throughout the movie. You also have a strong supporting cast of side characters voiced by Fortune Feimster, Andy Samberg, David Strathairn, Shakira, Idris Elba, Patrick Warburton, Quinta Brunson, Danny Trejo, Alan Tudyk, Nate Torrence, Don Lake, Bonnie Hunt, Jenny Slate and even Roman Reigns and CM Punk. The story of this movie is really good as it allows our leads to do something different. The action scenes are awesome and have the same energetic feel that was present in the first movie. And finally, the movie is paced very well with the story and it goes by pretty fast

Negatives for Zootopia 2 (2025):
The evil scheme of our main villain is very similar to the one from the original with a twist reveal that I saw coming from a mile away.

Overall, Zootopia 2 (2025) is a spectacular sequel to the original that was worth the nine year wait and I am interested to see if a third movie is going to be made.",47,7,0.25920696324951636,0.9963,0
rw10990957,masonsaul,9.0,2025-11-30,Disney's best animated film in years,"Zootopia 2 restores Disney animation to its former glory with a high quality sequel that plays to the exact same strengths as the original but doesn't repeat itself thematically. This is another really funny and fast paced adventure where Nick Wilde & Judy Hopps unravel an equally sinister yet more mature conspiracy which goes to the very top, now focused on how the rich use gentrification to expand their ambitions at the expense of those who are different, covering it all up by erasing history with propaganda afterwards.

Ginnifer Goodwin & Jason Bateman are a perfect pairing once again. Their chemistry is faultless and both of them have grown by the end with Ginnifer Goodwin's Judy eventually realising that she doesn't need to always carry the weight of the world on her shoulders and Jason Bateman's Nick has to finally open up by dropping his endless snark for a genuinely affecting moment. Ke Huy Quan playing Gary De'Snake is fantastic casting as the sensitivity he brings is ideal for a character who's designed to go against stereotypes.

Directors Jared Bush & Byron Howard deliver emotionally investing action and the new areas explored makes Zootopia feel even more vibrant, aided by highly detailed animation. Starting this story a week after the first one's narrative ended was a wise choice to avoid missing any character development and there's some hilariously unexpected references to other films as well as so many animal puns. Michael Giacchino's score is easily capable of constantly matching the film's energy and switching things up.",29,6,0.23786195286195286,0.9953,0
rw10979760,pugpool10,9.0,2025-11-26,Disney's still got the sauce,"First thing's first: I'm not a paid influencer shill, most of Disney's recent theatrical output has been fairly substandard and Bob Iger's pledge to integrate AI-generated content into his precious little streaming is nothing short of an insult to the human passion and creativity that Walt himself imbued into this company.

With that being said, I quite enjoyed myself here! I would have been happy to just see Nick and Judy again, but fortunately everything that surrounds them is mostly enjoyable, from the immersive world-building to the much-improved comedic timing (Patrick Warburton's horse mayor character is an absolute riot). Other than a few spots it doesn't suffer from that annoying trend in modern movies where it feels like a sterile product made to please the general audience-these characters go through the motions and struggle with themselves in the face of uncertain fate.

Jared Bush clearly gets what the people want.",77,14,0.1791666666666667,0.9339,0
rw10987783,i_odin,8.0,2025-11-29,Surprisingly Good,"Zootopia 2 is probably one of the better films to have come out of the Disney fold.

Set just after the events of the first film, it takes you back to the whimsical world of Zootopia (a portmanteau of ""zoo"" and ""utopia,"" perhaps), where adorable furry mammals live in a sophisticated, cosmopolitan city.

This sequel tackles issues that are both topical and important. Inclusivity and togetherness are universal themes, but when presented with such a clever and funny premise, they become part of an entertaining joyride.

The voice performances and animation are beautifully executed. The art style feels like a breath of fresh air compared to recent Pixar movies-helped, of course, by the fact that this is a sequel.

The writing is sharp, and the screenplay remains crisp and tight. There's genuine depth to the characters, making them more than just funny caricatures.

Overall, Zootopia 2 is an engaging, delightful film that comes highly recommended.",12,2,0.23248067408781697,0.9924,3

However, this movie exceeded my expectations by adding the issues on childhood trauma and personality disorders into the script. The details, music, and several hidden references along with a pretty solid plot are combined beautifully.

Before watching it, I had no expectations, as Disney had failed many times with their predictable, unnecessary stories, but this time, I was in shock; this is going to be one of my top animated films.

The animation was so beautiful and updated from its first film, like, absolutely amazing, with a strong background score filled with suspense and mystery. This is in between Go For It and Perfection!

The world expansion felt realistic, and each location felt connected, with genuine cinematic lighting and shots too.

Never thought I would feel goosebumps in a Disney movie after Frozen 2!

rw10985568,TapchantRandom,10.0,2025-11-28,Biggest Comedy,"Zootopia 2 is honestly one of the best sequels Disney has released, and it delivers laughs from start to finish. If the first movie had a great balance of humor and heart, this one pushes the comedy even further while still keeping the emotional moments strong. Judy and Nick are back with even better chemistry than before, and their comedic timing is perfect-every joke lands, every reaction is hilarious, and even the new characters add to the comedy without feeling forced.

What makes this sequel work so well is that it doesn't try too hard. The humor feels natural, smart, and well-paced, and the movie knows exactly how to use each character's personality to make the audience laugh. The world of Zootopia also feels bigger than ever. New locations, new species, and new situations all bring fresh comedic moments that feel original and never repetitive.

The animation is stunning, as expected from Disney, but what surprised me is how much personality they squeezed into every scene. The expressions, movements, and visual jokes are top-tier. It honestly feels like the creators had more fun this time, and you can feel that energy in every moment.

This movie is absolutely worth your money. Whether you're watching it with family, friends, or alone, you're guaranteed to laugh. It hits all the right notes-funny, charming, exciting, and full of heart. Zootopia 2 proves that animated sequels can be just as good, or even better, than the original.",23,7,0.2836219336219337,0.9979,2
rw10981929,jeremy-916-791020,8.0,2025-11-27,A movie that feels like Disney had fun making it.,"I'm going to be honest, I haven't been impressed with Disney's performance lately. I was concerned that they'd screw this up. My fears were unfounded. It's not common to find a movie which is as much fun to watch as it feels like the cast and crew had making it. Zootopia 2 is a movie about reconciling differences and discusses our modern society without getting preachy. It's a love letter to past Disney films and the art with references and cameos galore.

The pacing was excellent, characters' actions and motives are believable, visuals are excellent, and the humor stands on its own, not having to resort to cheap potty humor. It is also notable that the stakes are raised in this sequel, and the sequel, while it picks up where the first movie left off, is not merely riding on the popularity of the original (like so many sequels and remakes), but matches the original in quality.

This isn't a children's movie, but a true family film, enjoyable by all ages.",21,4,0.3739130434782609,0.9736,0

rw10982884,slashism,10.0,2025-11-27,A 2025 children's movie with lessons for adults,"Before I review, I must say, I haven't watched Zootopia 2's prequel and the last movie that I watched, with this style, was Toy Story back when I was a teenager.

I stay near a community with Chinese influences and without knowing much, I'm aware that this is the 'year of the snake'. To that I would add that the movie's release comes just in time where there is a lot divisiveness in the world over petty things while also there is effort to ease relations between US and China or similar situations within countries or across. This is good timing guys, this is art done right.

I liked how the film tries to correct the negative caricature snakes have had to bear, mostly due to the misinterpretation of the Bible and people's fear of a mysterious animal. The caging, killing, trafficking of snakes for rituals/ superstitions and what not has become a sport for the few involved in it and while people have been caught, it hasn't been treated as serious of a crime as it should be. Yet, it is one of the creatures closely connected to the Earth, physically. I remember when I would dine near the woods, snakes would casually pass by, doing their thing, just like birds with no intention to harm. On the whole, snakes are misunderstood. Not all of them are out to get ya! This reminds me of an early episode from The Simpsons where Lisa Simpson tries to stop people from killing snakes. Very thoughtful then as it is now! One wonders if the values passed down back then (~30 yrs) really did make it far, given that a similar effort from cinema is required now.

I enjoyed the film's comedic elements as an adult and also the different geographies it involved. It pays tribute to various other films, which is a treat for a movie lover. Going through the credits, I could witness people from different backgrounds being involved which goes with the spirit of the film. Not only do we get to see a variety of animals, but also their real natures as well as their mythological characterizations intertwined as accurately as possible (for a movie) in a way that is ultimately engaging, entertaining, humorous and vividly colorful without being disrespectful. There are dark moments in the film but it is laugh-out-loud funny for the most part. And, to my surprise, there were a lot of truth bombs about the nature of our current world. Very layered film and not overtly preachy. Perhaps, worth a second watch. The preachiness that you may have sensed from my review is well layered/ not obvious. I tend to view it politically because I follow the news, I guess. But it's enjoyable without that angle as well. Watch it on the big screen, not very close and bring your sense of humour along. I thank the filmmakers for making this film and appreciate the apt timing of it's release. We need this in 2025.",20,7,0.10734861845972957,0.9913,4

It feels like this movie is riding the coattails of its predecessor and using a lot of the same themes it did before. It also isn't as fun or whimsical as Zootopia. There are humorous moments, but the overall tone is fairly serious. I like the animation, the characters, the new song, and the expanded universe.

rw10987472,anchitbaishya2004,8.0,2025-11-29,A Solid Sequel,"Zootopia 2 is a BLAST!!! Honestly after being disappointed by Disney Animation's last three outings, I had low to moderate expectations going in to Zootopia 2, but it not only met those expectations, it exceeded them. This was worth the 9 year wait. Let's talk about what works so well about the movie.

Nick and Judy are a dynamic duo. Their chemistry is truly what drives this movie. While the first movie established their partnership, the sequel delves deep into their relationship and their differences providing for some solid comic relief moments and some hard hitting emotional ones. There are new characters introduced as well, of which Gary De'Snake and Pawbert Lynxley were the standouts. The movie is also visually stunning with vibrant locations, expressive character designs and gorgeous lighting. The world building is rich and expansive leading to new hidden parts of the animal city. The humor is clever and there tons of references to past Disney movies and other Hollywood flicks. The themes of discrimination, stereotypes and social exclusion are strong. The voice performances were amazing ofcourse particularly by Ginnifer Goodwin as Judy Hopps, Jason Bateman as Nick Wilde, Ke Huy Quan as Gary De'Snake and Andy Samberg as Pawbert Lynxley. And the plot feels more mature and darker this time with a more thrilling mystery and higher stakes.

That said, there were some pacing issues in the middle half and some of the jokes may not land as neatly. Though these are just minor nitpicks as the movie largely succeeds on all other levels.

Overall, Zootopia 2 is a solid sequel that masterfully expands on it's predecessor's strong themes and rich world building with stunning animation, fun new characters and sharp humor providing for an amazing time at the movies.",10,3,0.18794063079777365,0.9985,0
rw10982589,MrDHWong,8.0,2025-11-27,Another fun buddy pair up of its two lead characters that should keep fans of the original happy,"""Zootopia 2"" is the sequel to the 2016 animated Disney film ""Zootopia"". Directed by Jared Bush and Byron Howard and once again featuring the voices of Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman, it is another fun buddy pair up of its two lead characters that should keep fans of the original happy.

One week after the events of the first film, Judy Hopps (voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin) and Nick Wilde (voiced by Jason Bateman) have been working for the Zootopia Police Department (ZPD) as partners, though their contrasting personalities cause numerous problems for those around them. After the pair mess up a case, Chief Bogo (voiced by Idris Elba) forces the two to attend a therapy class to control their reckless natures, otherwise he will separate them permanently. However, during the duo's bungled case, Judy believes that a snake has somehow entered Zootopia for the first time in over a hundred years due to her discovering a piece of snakeskin at the scene, and finds clues that point to the reptilian creature appearing at the upcoming Zootenial Gala. Going against Chief Bogo's orders, Judy and Nick sneak their way into the Gala where they meet Gary De'Snake (voiced by Ke Huy Quan), a pit viper who reveals to the pair that the entire history of Zootopia's founding is based around a terrible lie.

Nine years ago, Disney released what I would consider to be one of the best animated films of the 2010s; a brightly coloured romp about a rabbit and a fox called ""Zootopia"". As well as providing a great deal of lively entertainment for younger viewers, this film also contained some cleverly woven in social commentary on racial prejudice and stereotypes that older audiences can appreciate on its own. Best of all, the film managed to combine all of these elements together in a way that never made it feel preachy or condescending, allowing it to become popular among audiences of virtually all ages. Almost a decade later, ""Zootopia 2"" continues the story of these anthropomorphic animals in a sequel that further proves that this mismatched pairing of Judy and Nick are still worth watching.

Picking up just barely a week after the first movie, we see that Judy the rabbit and Nick the fox are still on good terms with each other, partnered together to patrol crime throughout the city of Zootopia as ZPD officers. Despite their good intentions, the pair's differing views on how to keep the citizens safe puts them at odds with each other, with Judy choosing to do things by the book and Nick idealising a more hands-on, forceful approach, almost like a classic ""good cop, bad cop"" dynamic. Naturally, this all reaches a boiling point once the two of them end up causing a major accident while chasing a van filled with criminals, leading to the threat of their partnership being permanently ended. This is a nice way to remind the audience of the conflicting nature of animals who are predators versus animals who are prey, which in this case is used to show the difficulties of a rabbit and a fox joining forces to bring down a gang of misfits.

From this point forward, the film starts to take on a different tone to the original, focusing on the darker aspects surrounding the history behind Zootopia itself. It is revealed to the audience that reptiles, especially snakes, have not been seen in the city for over a century, leading to mass panic when a pit viper named Gary suddenly turns up at the Zootenial Gala. Unlike his frightening reputation as a snake, Gary is shown to be friendly and wishes to help Judy and Nick remove the stigma his species has so that they can all live happily alongside every other animal in Zootopia. This plays into one of the key things I enjoyed about the original movie; the world-building. Here, we get to see Judy and Nick visit the Marsh Market, a secret community located on the swampy outskirts of Zootopia, where all kinds of reptilian creatures like turtles and lizards congregate. Without revealing too much more, I liked how this place gives off the impression of a neglected slum filled with rejected animals whom society has choosen to look down upon, turning it into a hotspot for crime and corruption.

Much like its predecessor, the film is vibrant and colourful at the best of times, yet isn't afraid to look dark and seedy whenever the plot calls for it. This allows the environments that the characters move through to be just as immersive as before, only this time on a slightly larger scale. The aforementioned Marsh Market features a nice demonstration of the film's creative colour palette, showcasing some sepia-toned lighting whenever Judy and Nick are exploring the interiors of the buildings. In one scene, the pair enter a blues bar filled with amphibian musicians, tortoise bouncers guarding the doors, and a short-tempered sea lion performer who hates being mistaken for a seal. As the duo wander through the decrepit building, they meet with a criminal basilisk named Jesús, who being voiced by Danny Trejo should clue you in to how dangerous he is as a character. What I liked here was how this whole scene played out in the style of a violent crime thriller with a humorously family-friendly tone, something rather difficult to pull off in a movie intended for all ages.

In terms of humour, most of the comedy comes from the same mismatched pairing of Judy and Nick. Judy essentially acts as the straight woman to Nick's sly, wisecracking demeanour, which was a winning formula last time but does occasionally become repetitive here. Similarly, the jokes about each respective animal we see in this movie are very hit-and-miss, with there unfortunately being more misses than hits. Some examples of jokes that I thought worked were of smaller animals terrifying the larger ones, like with a tiny mouse causing a huge elephant to panic and require trauma counselling along with Judy and Nick. Likewise, I was happy to see the extremely slow sloths return in this film, as their meandering antics were one of my favourite jokes in the first movie. On the other hand, ones that didn't tended to drag on longer than they should, like with a group of walruses who only communicate by saying ""Yep"" over and over. While it was funny at first, the joke didn't need to go on for over five minutes and by the time it finished, it left me feeling more annoyed than humoured.

Yet again demonstrating their solid chemistry, both Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman are great fun to watch as Judy and Nick, respectively. As mentioned earlier, Judy is a great straight woman to play off Nick's wisecracks, and Goodwin and Bateman perfectly embody these traits like last time. Even though this film takes place only a week after the first one, it is clear that each of the two have grown considerably in that period. For instance, Judy is still optimistic as she was before yet is now considerably pragmatic in how she approaches her job, whereas Nick retains his street smart attitude towards his position as a cop with a more altruistic inclination towards protecting others. It's nice to see character development like this, even if it seems somewhat minor in regards to the rest of the plot. As for the rest of the cast, Idris Elba got a few chuckles out of me as Chief Bogo and Ke Huy Quan is also a welcome edition as Gary. There are also a few other voiceover cameos that some fans of the original movie might be able to recognise as well, but I won't be spoiling any surprises here.

Although it doesn't contain the same level of freshness as the first movie, ""Zootopia 2"" is still a mostly enjoyable sequel that caters primarily to fans of the series in general. There's just something satisfying about witnessing the wacky adventures of a peppy rabbit and a sly fox solving crimes together, almost like it's an affectionate nod to Saturday Morning Cartoons many older generations who are now parents themselves likely grew up watching. Without disclosing what actually happens, the film features a post-credits scene that is most definitely hinting towards a third film in the future. Judging by what transpires, things seem to be heading in high and exciting directions.

I rate it 7.5/10.",8,3,0.16513468820515806,0.999,4
rw10979892,JCeran,8.0,2025-11-26,A Great Sequel?,"Zootopia 2 (a follow-up to Zootopia (2016)) follows the cop duo Judy (the do-good bunny) and Nick (the shifty fox) as they navigate their new partnership, make friends along the way, and uncover hidden secrets. But, at what cost???

I just came out of the film, and I thought it was great!

The film picks up right where Zootopia (2016) left off, with Judy and Nick-still semi-fresh from saving the city-now working as a police duo trying to find their footing in the department, all while discovering that things aren't always what they seem. The film does a great job jumping right into the story and action! I think the film's appeal, like the original's, really comes from the mystery, the humor, the character chemistry, and the overall message of accepting others for who they are-all while gearing itself toward kids, families, and a general audience. The film also did a great job expanding the world-building and introducing new characters, all the while keeping me invested and on the edge of my seat. I thought the sequel delivered on all those fronts.

While the mystery was a standout, what truly hooked me was the character development between Judy and Nick. You really get to see more of their partnership here, and the film does a great job showing their different perspectives, the tensions, the needs, and the tougher moments that come with being partners-many of which adults will appreciate more than kids. I found myself just as invested in their relationship as I was in the overarching mystery, and honestly, their relationship really became the highlight of the film for me.

The cast performances were great! Returning voices Ginnifer Goodwin (as Judy, the bunny) and Jason Bateman (as Nick, the fox) both really carried the movie for me. I also loved the new additions of Ke Huy Quan (as the Snake), Andy Samberg (as Pawbert), and Fortune Feimster (the crazy beaver), along with the supporting cast, who all helped elevate the film. The film also brought back a few familiar voices from Zootopia (2016) that were fun additions/callbacks, along with some new cameos. I also thought Shakira's new number, ""Zoo,"" was well done.

My only caveat was that after seeing the trailers, I felt like right at the beginning of the movie I had already guessed the plot, which ended with me not being very satisfied with the payoff. I still got surprised by a twist or two, but for the most part, I felt like the movie was predictable. I also thought the beginning of the film was well written, but near the end, I felt like some of the suspense dissipates due to the delivery being rushed. Saying all that, I still enjoyed the film tremendously!!

As a side note, I think the attention to detail was great-especially the many nods to Disney's own self-awareness. There was a weatherman named Bob Tiger (a nod to Disney's CEO Bob Iger), and a news channel called ZNN (referencing CNN), along with many others. I just thought they were fun pokes at Disney, by Disney.

Overall, Zootopia 2 delivers a good sequel thanks to its story, character development, and humor (it was pun-ny), all wrapped in stunning animation while delivering a great message! I would recommend it for kids, families, and really any viewer alike. And don't fur-get to stay until the end of the credits...

We got another perfect film that continues the story in such a natural way, expanding the universe with new worlds and characters, while once again diving deep into important themes like prejudice and bias, social divisions, community trust and policing, diversity and inclusion, cooperation, misinformation and media influence, personal growth and identity, and political and societal change. All of this is delivered through wonderful writing filled with humor, adventure, action, mystery, twists, emotional moments, and so much more. You almost forget you're watching an animated movie because everything is executed so well.

This time around, there's even more humor, but it's done so intelligently that the film perfectly balances being an animated movie for kids and just as much for adults, with brilliant puns and genius pop-culture references-even nods to other Disney films and cult classics. The animation is stunning in every way, and you can clearly see why the nine-year wait. Nothing feels less than perfect-from the visuals, cinematography, character and set design, and world-building, to the performances, sound, and score. We even get another incredible theme song from Shakira, even better than the first.

The new characters are just as memorable and iconic, and everyone returning truly shines. You leave the theater feeling happy, fulfilled, and even more connected to these characters and this world-and, based on the after-credits scene, wanting more stories.

""Zootopia 2"" stars the cutest bunny since Peter Rabbit, ""Officer Judy Hopps"" (voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin) from ""Bunny Borrows"" where the population is always increasing.

Jason Bateman provides plenty of laughs as the wily fox ""Nick Wilde"".

One of my fave actors Idris Elba is back as the ""Carrots"" boss the Buffalo ""Chief Bogo"".

The brave rabbit cop teams up again with the fox to crack a new case in this buddy comedy that picks up exactly where the last one left off and even gives you a recap.

Honestly this felt like a weird way to start a feature animation film because I felt discombobulated at first, but then it settles down into another fun adventure with plenty of laughs, most of your favourite characters and colourful places in ""Zootopia"".

""2"" may have taken 9 years to screen after the first film, but it takes place only one week later from the original's timeline.

It pays to watch the first flick on Disney even though their streaming subscriptions are going up yet again!

The animation is as amazing as the first film with a few tried and tested scenes repeated in slightly different form with a similar end result and another nice twist to make M. Night Shyamalan blush with envy.

Lookout for: the fastest moving Sloth at the DMV ""Flash"" (Raymond S. Persi) as a getaway driver and Robert Irwin as the Koala ""Robert Furwin"".

After his ""Dancing With The Stars"" Mirrorball win stateside he can do no wrong

There's a new Mayor in town and Patrick Warburton relishes the role, plus the last Mayor makes a very funny cameo.

Where this franchise shines is its intimate knowledge of animals, their movements, habits and how to bring that into this fantasy world where all creatures, great and small, live in harmony.

Even if some of the community follow author George Orwells 1984 theory that ""some are created more equal than others"".

Lynx's I'm looking at you!

Sure there's lots of messages and takeaways which can feel preachy at times, but that's the world we all live in today.

""Zootopia 2"" has attracted an incredible voice over cast and even includes some VO Actors, not just Hollywood Superstars.

Please Disney hire me for something, not just the Brand Disney USA campaign for Disney World in Florida, throw me a frickin' bone so I can afford your price hikes.

Good to see both Jared Bush and Byron Howard as both directors and writers attached to this sequel and brace yourself because this is going to become a trilogy.

If you are looking for a movie that's every bit as exciting and heartwarming as the OG to take your children or grandchildren to this Summer and still enjoy it on an adult level then book your seats now for one of this holidays blockbusters.

There are some deep conversations about the need for therapy, the challenges of teamwork, and how lies and manipulation impact the outlook on races and cultures. However, the content feels watered down, overdone at times and just not as impactful as the original.

rw10983953,TheMovieSearch,10.0,2025-11-28,So amazing,"Zootopia 2, the long-awaited 2025 sequel to Disney's beloved original, marks a triumphant return to form for the studio. Far from being just another animated follow-up, this film serves as a reminder of why Disney dominated family entertainment for decades. With strong critic scores, overwhelmingly positive audience reactions, and a box-office trajectory that points toward a massive success, it's clear that Disney has rediscovered the magic that made the first Zootopia a phenomenon.

The story once again follows Judy Hopps, voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin, and Nick Wilde, voiced by Jason Bateman, as they embark on an exhilarating new adventure that widens the scope of the Zootopia universe. Their journey introduces a new beaver character and a snake named Gary, while also weaving in familiar faces from the first film. The script balances nostalgia with fresh ideas, allowing returning characters to shine without overshadowing the newcomers or the story's emotional core.

What stands out most is how the film embraces twists and turns that genuinely surprise without ever feeling forced. The world-building remains exceptional-dense with detail, humor, and personality-and the animation quality is nothing short of stunning. Every cityscape, character design, and visual gag serves a purpose, reinforcing just how immersive this world has become. Fans of the original will find endless joy in seeing beloved characters interact with new ones in ways that feel organic and deeply satisfying.

The addition of new antagonistic forces gives the story richer stakes, expanding the moral and thematic depth that made the first movie resonate across all ages. The film remains entertaining for children while offering plenty of layered storytelling for adults, continuing Disney's tradition of tackling sophisticated ideas through accessible, character-driven narratives. It's a rare sequel that grows with its audience, honoring what came before while confidently moving forward.

Credit must be given to the director, screenwriters, animators, and creative team, all of whom elevate the film beyond typical sequel territory. Their work results in a story that feels both grand in scale and intimate in emotion. The pacing is sharp, the humor lands consistently, and the emotional beats are genuine without ever becoming cloying. It's clear the filmmakers approached the project with passion and respect for the world they were expanding.

Zootopia 2 is a vibrant, heartfelt, and thoroughly engaging experience that reaffirms why the franchise remains so beloved. It's the kind of film that deserves to be seen on the biggest screen possible, enjoyed with an enthusiastic audience, and revisited once it becomes available at home. Disney has crafted something special-an animated sequel that not only justifies its existence but elevates everything that made the first film memorable.

For families, animation lovers, and Disney fans in general, this is an absolute must-see. The studio proves once again why it sits at the top of the entertainment world, and this sequel earns every bit of its five-star praise.",8,5,0.284469696969697,0.9961,2

1) the overall textures on different elements clash like character models, background, foreground etc.

2) the composition seems either AI generated and/or derived from highly stylized still image --> effect is that everything around the ""still moment"" isn't in style with the moment.

rw10984612,SAMTHEBESTEST,5.0,2025-11-28,Disney's Animal Kingdom Goes Down,"Zootopia 2 (2025)
Movie Review -

Disney's Zootopia was a decent-to-good animated feature that won hearts globally and became a massive box office success - surprising many along the way. With Disney's ongoing trend of commercial-driven sequels, Zootopia 2 was inevitable. Unfortunately, what arrives feels like a downgrade. Disney's animal metropolis still delivers a passable adventure, but there's very little here that excites you for the future - unless it earns enough to force Zootopia 3 into existence. This time, the animals confront a long-buried secret, while the beloved leading duo struggles to stay in sync during their latest case. There are moments of fun and wild energy, but never quite enough, especially because the emotional beats fail to land with real impact.

The story picks up after the events of the first film, with Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) and Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman) continuing their mission to protect Zootopia. When Judy stumbles upon a mysterious secret from the city's past - a truth that must be exposed for everyone's safety - the authorities immediately shut her down. Nick, worried about the consequences and danger involved, hesitates and tells her, ""It's not worth dying for,"" leaving Judy to pursue the mission alone. Things escalate when Nick is captured, and the entire force is sent after Judy to stop her before she uncovers the truth. The question remains: Can Judy outsmart everyone and reveal what has been hidden for years?

Writer Jared Bush clearly kept the essence of the original in mind - wild chases, mysterious cases, clever humor, and familiar buddy-cop banter. But instead of evolving the formula, he simply rewrites the same playbook. As a result, the narrative feels repetitive, as if we've already seen this movie before. The introduction of snakes as antagonistic characters does bring in a spark, largely because it plays off common fears and expectations - and the twist involving them is genuinely enjoyable. Thankfully, the brisk screenplay ensures the film never becomes an outright bore, with its runtime slightly over ninety minutes. However, the jokes mostly miss the mark, the drama is lukewarm, and the original film's quirky, inventive energy is noticeably absent. Even the emotional final stretch barely stirs any real feelings.

While animation films rely less on traditional acting, voice performances are crucial, and this sequel boasts a star-packed ensemble - Ginnifer Goodwin, Jason Bateman, Ke Huy Quan, Fortune Feimster, Andy Samberg, David Strathairn, Shakira, Idris Elba, Patrick Warburton, Quinta Brunson, Danny Trejo, Alan Tudyk, Nate Torrence, Don Lake, Bonnie Hunt, Jenny Slate, among others. They breathe enough life into their respective characters, but nobody particularly stands out. It's a competent, but not memorable, effort.

Visually, Zootopia 2 remains colorful and vibrant just like its predecessor, but the world-building lacks variety and fresh imagination. The sound design is adequate, the editing remains sharp, and the visual effects are serviceable - yet surprisingly rarely awe-inducing. The climactic action sequence, meant to be grand and threatening, feels strangely small and rushed. Directors Jared Bush and Byron Howard play it too safe. Zootopia 2 isn't a terrible sequel, but it isn't an impressive one either. It settles into comfortable mediocrity - something some audiences may still enjoy simply because the world feels familiar. It definitely could have been bigger, bolder, and more heartfelt... it just didn't try hard enough. Agree or disagree, but you'll have less fun at movies!

rw10986624,moviesfilmsreviewsinc,10.0,2025-11-29,Disney still has it in them to write phenomenal sequels,"In ""Zootopia 2,"" the groundbreaking bunny-fox team of Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde returns to confront systemic injustice, greed, and personal shortcomings. Continuing from the 2016 original, the film sees Judy, the ambitious bunny, and Nick, the savvy con-fox, as they enjoy their previous success and search for a new case. Their adventure leads them to the introduction of the first snake in Zootopia in decades, bringing them into contact with both returning characters and new mammals. A significant aspect of the film is its dual audience appeal, balancing a children's movie surface with layered social critiques that merit serious consideration. The film showcases impressive animation styles emblematic of technological advancements over the past decade, with vibrant colors and ambitious lighting. The production design shines, particularly in the comedic gala scene that captured the attention of both the critic and their children. This sequence demonstrates strong suspense-building typical of detective stories, with effective action that combines humor and excitement. The cleverness of the animal puns and jokes is a continuing highlight, creating an enjoyable atmosphere for viewers, especially children. However, the film's pacing falters at times, notably during a moment of exposition that feels overly drawn-out, interrupting the narrative flow as it seeks to clarify the protagonists' plan. Despite this, the overarching themes of racism and prejudice remain central, with new characters introducing fresh storylines, although at times the volume of social issues addressed risks superficiality rather than deeper engagement. The plot intricately interweaves corruption and generational theft, highlighting Judy's commitment to enacting change within Zootopia, contrasting with Nick's more skeptical stance. Ultimately, ""Zootopia 2"" embodies a hopeful message, positioning Judy's determination as a catalyst for change amidst a plethora of weighty social themes.",6,4,0.1737215909090909,0.9915,4

Nick and Judy still struggle to express their true feelings for each other, but their actions say it all. Even though they're completely different, their care for one another runs deep - and that connection becomes their greatest asset. They challenge each other, shift each other's perspectives, and prove once again that the strongest teams are built on trust, honesty, and shared mission... and a humble attitude.

As new threats rise to the surface, they gather a few unlikely teammates along the way. Each character adds a strength the others don't have, reminding us that real teams are like a complex puzzle - uniquely pieced together but unstoppable when aligned.

Through setbacks, surprises, and moments when the odds feel impossible, Nick and Judy keep going. Their determination becomes the heartbeat of the movie. They show that:
You don't have to be the same to be strong togetherCourage grows when it's sharedPurpose becomes clearer in the middle of adversityAnd love - in whatever quiet form it takes - is fuel for grit

At its core, ""Zootopia 2"" is a celebration of unlikely partnerships, second chances, and the kind of can't-quit/won't quit attitude that changes entire cities. Nick, Judy, and their team remind us that when you fight for something bigger than yourself with a Champion mindset, nothing - not fear, not differences, not pressure - can stop purpose- and what's possible.

It's a story of friendship, resilience, and the unstoppable force of a team on mission.",7,1,0.055276907001044935,0.9973,4
rw10981140,ejumper_,9.0,2025-11-26,Surprisingly amazing sequel,"Zootopia 2 is without a doubt the best animated movie of the year and one of the best animated sequels Disney has ever made. This makes Wreck It Ralph 2 and Moana 2 look even more embarrassing which I didn't know was possible. It was a really, really solid movie that blew my expectations out of the water.

I love the first movie since it was on repeat throughout most of my childhood and it holds up even stronger to this day. But I was worried for the second movie. Disney's track record with sequels is bad, let's be honest. And then when you combine that with the fact that the first trailers for this movie made it look like slop, I wasn't excited. But as I said, this completely blew me away. As for being better than the first, I don't really know if I agree with that yet. There are loads of things that I believe are better than the first film, but also loads of things that are on par or slightly worse.

I think the overall plot is better. It directly improves the plot of the first movie by going even deeper and darker. The villains in this movie are DIABOLICALLY evil for a kids film, which further adds to the plot. It takes the themes of segregation and racial profiling from the first film and amplifies it times 10 by adding, I kid you not, gentrification and political corruption. I was completely blown away by how well done this all was. The humor is also way better. This might be one of the funniest Disney movies I've ever seen. And that says something, because I don't really laugh at movies like that (especially not kids movies). A lot of the humor is just so chaotic and insane and constantly builds up. It's like when your friend is making you laugh but keeps adding to the joke to the point where you can't breathe. Definitely not on that same level, but I got a similar feeling. One last big improvement is the character development. The character development in the first movie is already one of its biggest strengths, so the fact that it's better here is a wild achievement. Most of the development is given to Judy and Nick as a team, which sounds redundant, but it makes more sense when you watch the film.

I only have two major complaints, and that's the pacing and the world-building. The world-building is definitely a positive of both movies, however, I felt like there was a bit of a missed opportunity to go bolder in this sequel. I'm fairly satisfied with what they did, and liked seeing the history of Zootopia, but I wish they physically explored a couple more areas of the city. As for the pacing, it gets really uneven in the third act. The last 15 minutes of this movie moves at a breakneck pace, but at the same time, will suddenly slow down for a couple intense scenes. It's just very jarring to watch imo.

Anyway, this is a fantastic movie and probably the perfect sequel to Zootopia. I really don't know if it's better than the first, however. As a whole, I think it's on par. But when you break the movie down into its individual parts, it's easier to see where this movie improves over the first. I highly recommend this movie, especially as someone who was very skeptical of it at first.",16,10,0.15761704886704883,0.9979,0

The movie was also adventurous too because where got to see different areas of the all animal universe of Disney's. None of these other places are Judy's old small town but heritaged areas where different types of animals live. I will be talking about - when they find the snake named Gary.

We get told way more information about Zootopia & the fact that it was invented by a reptile snake but a family of big cats hid the information. So maybe, it is another dose of tackling racism.

Whilst my favourite character is still Gazelle, I liked Brian Whindancer, he is so dramatic & I love it & I like him better than Lionheart.

rw10986940,ThienQuangN-8,10.0,2025-11-29,Worth the wait !!!,"Zootopia 2 is an absolute triumph, a film that not only justifies its nearly decade-long wait but spectacularly surpasses every expectation fans had after the brilliance of the original. From the very first frame to the final note, it feels like a love letter to everyone who fell in love with Zootopia in 2016, yet it boldly evolves into something richer, deeper, and even more breathtaking.

The animation is nothing short of revolutionary. Disney Animation has pushed the boundaries of what fur, fabric, lighting, and facial expression can achieve. Every strand of Judy's fur reacts to wind and water with astonishing realism, while Nick's sly smirks and subtle eyebrow movements carry more personality than many live-action performances. The city of Zootopia itself has grown exponentially more alive: rain-slicked streets in Rainforest District reflect neon signs with photorealistic precision, the flickering bioluminescent flora in the Night District pulses like a living heartbeat, and the sweeping camera moves through bustling crowds feel impossibly grand yet intimately detailed. It is, without exaggeration, one of the most beautiful animated films ever made.

Michael Giacchino's score is a masterwork of emotion and energy. He retains the playful, jazzy spirit of the first film but expands it into something far more sophisticated and emotionally resonant. The main theme returns with triumphant new variations that gave me goosebumps in the theater, while new motifs for the expanded world weave seamlessly into the narrative. The song ""Try Everything Again"" (performed once more by Shakira) is an instant earworm that somehow feels even more uplifting than the original, and the way Giacchino blends diegetic music from Zootopia's diverse districts (salsa in Sahara Square, K-pop in Tundratown's nightlife, haunting nocturnal folk in the new districts) creates an immersive soundscape that makes the city feel culturally alive and breathing.

The story is where Zootopia 2 truly soars beyond its predecessor. What could have been a safe sequel instead delivers a narrative of remarkable depth, tackling themes of generational trauma, forgiveness, found family, and the danger of weaponizing empathy with nuance rarely seen in family entertainment. The plot twists are clever, earned, and often heartbreakingly clever, building to a third act that had the entire audience gasping, laughing, and openly weeping within minutes of each other. It is smarter, braver, and more emotionally honest than almost any animated sequel in history.

Yet despite its weighty themes, the film remains relentlessly joyful and charming. The humor is sharper, faster, and more delightfully witty than ever; Nick and Judy's banter reaches iconic rom-com levels of chemistry, while new characters (especially a certain sloth receptionist who steals every scene) deliver laugh-out-loud moments that feel fresh rather than recycled. The film is funny in ways that respect the audience's intelligence, never punching down, always sparkling with warmth and wit.

Zootopia 2 doesn't just meet the sky-high expectations of a ten-year wait; it shatters them, delivering a sequel that is bigger, bolder, more beautiful, funnier, deeper, and infinitely more meaningful than anyone dared hope. It is not merely better than the first film; it is one of the greatest achievements in animated storytelling ever created. Run, don't walk, to see it. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll want to watch it again the moment the credits roll. Ten years was worth every second.",6,2,0.3087108509643721,0.9996,2

Attending a 1:30 PM showing on opening day to find a 90% full theater was truly exhilarating. A strong case that theatrical releases, rather than immediate streaming dumps, are what the public craves. The atmosphere in the packed room was electric, and the film itself mirrored this energy. From the opening scene to the final credits, the sequel was an explosion of energy that kept the entire audience-myself included-glued to the screen, proving that Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde still have plenty of hustle left.

Not only does Zootopia 2 exceed the pace of its predecessor, it stands out as a rare sequel that is objectively much better than the original. The narrative this time around is exceptionally intriguing and interesting, weaving new social commentary into a slick detective plot while maintaining fantastic forward momentum. But what truly elevates it is the humor. I found myself laughing out loud repeatedly, especially during the brilliant re-execution of a classic recurring gag from the first film-it's somehow funnier and more refined this time around.

I truly think this second film is better than the first film and I really loved the direction they took the film with this story. I just absolutely love the animation style in these films and these movies feel so fresh and unique as well and I truly love the chemistry between Nick and Judy and they are easily my favorite parts of the film and I really think all these characters in this film are great. I really like how the story of this film does something new and allow us to see our two leads doing something different and new. There's also some really great action moments throughout the film and I absolutely love the action throughout the movie and it's animated so smoothly. I also found all the references to be hilarious in this film and there's some absolutely amazing jokes in this movie and some jokes I did not expect them to do at all but I was dying. I also think the movie has some really strong emotional moments and there's so many scenes which have so much substance and emotion which elevate this film even higher for me. Just a few negatives for me from this film is I feel like the movie was very predictable at times and there's some moments which were super easy to predict especially the twist near the end of the film and I also think our main villains were kinda lame and they don't really do a whole lot to this film for me. My last tiny complaint is sometimes the film relies too much on the comedy aspects and some of the jokes just didn't land for me but I think a majority of them were really great though. I think this movie is just a ton of fun and it's a great time especially seeing this world and our characters again and this is easily worth the watch in my opinion.,4,2,0.2584194890077243,0.9967,0

Zootopia 2 is no different. It's pretty, some good jokes, and who doesn't like the cast, the characters or the world. But that's it. This instalment doesn't add much that the first didn't already. Besides, the timeline of the plot and even reversing character and relationship progress made from the first film is a mess.

Behind the scenes at Disney it makes you think that the criteria to get into the writer's room isn't about creative and sharp writing skills, but 'will this person present a story that holds our value set?'

It's like all of these films are about the same thing. Acceptance, tolerance, everyone is equal, never listen to stereotypes and so on. Our Judy Hopps will show Nick the value of all of these things and fix him. It's exhausting.

Back in the day movies made stories with these values, but also so many other ones. There was also different ideas and solutions to problems and progress and it helped kids learn nuance.

It was beautiful to see how much depth and care went into developing them.

Another major highlight was learning how the city of Zoomanina came to be. The way the world was built and explained was not only fascinating but also visually and narratively stunning.

My only criticism is the relationship between Nick and Judy. Despite all the hints and unspoken moments, Nick's feelings for Judy still aren't clearly confirmed. It's obvious that he feels more for her than he admits - you can see it in every gesture and every glance. And yes, he loves her. It's a shame the film keeps this aspect unresolved.

rw10979722,thefoochie,4.0,2025-11-26,Depressingly mediocre,"This doesn't try enough to even be a legitimate disaster, so all we get is perfectly watchable, but entirely forgettable sludge. I mean, I wasn't expecting much after seeing the previews, which genuinely looked like AI-generated YouTube ads instead of trailers. Despite this, I went in with an open mind, and sadly it sucked. The original was one of my favorite movies as a kid (I still have it rated a 10 on IMDb) and maybe I'm getting some residual enjoyment from all those years ago, cause Judy and Nick remained as charming as ever. The problem is, all of the surrounding elements are extremely underwhelming. Judy and Nick have zero internal struggles, and the only conflict that comes from their relationship is ""will their differences tear them apart?"" This is such a weak hook because we already saw these two characters bond in the first film and get over their wildly opposing personalities. In this one, they try to spin it as a difference of values, but the drama is completely inert. Here's the thing: Nick makes it clear multiple times that his hesitation to pursue this case is because he doesn't want Judy or himself to die, but Judy (and the film) treats this as a character flaw. Nick's entire character arc is learning how to express that he cares about Judy, but isn't saying ""I don't want you to die"" basically a form of admitting love already? I feel like he communicated well enough, what's the problem here? And of course the film takes Judy's side and has Nick be the only one who grows. It's annoying because the fact that Judy and Nick survived doesn't automatically make her right. Of course they survived, it's a kids' movie! If Nick knew that he had plot armor and there were no stakes, then he'd agree with Judy obviously! This is why creating drama around the fear of death in an unrealistic Disney movie is an inherently bad idea. In the Zootopia universe, Judy is correct, but in any other scenario, Nick would be in the right.

The comedy is probably the best part of the film, as there were a couple jokes that got a laugh out of me. Though there were way too many gags where the punchline is that it seems like Judy and Nick are dating. I honestly wasn't sure if the joke was that these two are incompatible, or if it's that they're in love but don't realize it. Even by the end, I was still confused as to whether their relationship was platonic or romantic. The plot is also pretty basic and lame. After a super dumb scene that sets the story in motion where Judy is accused of an attempted murder, the two protagonists spend the rest of the film on the run. This is not felt in any way, and I completely forgot that they were fugitives. The villains end up tracking them down in the most unimaginative way possible: by tracking their phones. They seriously couldn't use anything animal-related to have this happen? At least the beaver escaped prison cause they're a beaver, so the visual gag made up for the lazy writing. We also get a prison escape sequence where Nick and the beaver accidentally release the other prisoners, who immediately try to kill them. Disney has to remind us that it's only these two characters who were wrongfully imprisoned, but remember that all the other prisoners are no good criminals! It's hilarious cause the world building attempted to establish that the people in power were corrupt, so I guess they forgot about that. The twist villain is alright, but they do nothing with the reveal. The plot wraps up so neatly that I honestly thought there would be another 30 minutes to the film. One of the most ""that's it?"" climaxes ever. After 9 years, this is what they came up with? Can't believe two stars of eeaao have been in back to back stinkers, they need to make better decisions.

rw10991178,ztmillers-2,8.0,2025-11-30,The Rare Character-Centric Sequel,"Any follow-up to the 2016 masterpiece, Zootopia, is going to be disadvantaged. Cinema was still a year ahead of Jordan Peele's ""Get Out"" when Disney released one of the most articulate explanations of race, allyship, and accountability ever put to film. Now that everyone knows how good, even ""timely,"" a Disney pic can be, how do you surprise everyone a second time?

The insights in this sequel won't spur any new chapters in your sociology 101 textbook. Though honestly, neither was the deflection of white saviourship that novel back in 2016. We more or less knew how racial profiling and biases played out in the landscape. What surprised many of us (and validated the rest of us) was the idea that these ideas could be articulated so eloquently in a children's film.

It seems that the studio tried the same thing here with Zootopia 2 that it did with Frozen II six years ago. I think a lot of people wanted that movie to find more princess tropes to rebut; what they ended up doing was just following the tracks of the characters and unearthing deeper insights, richer epiphanies. I found myself really appreciating that then, and I think it works here too. Byron Howard and Jared Bush appear to have caught onto the idea that nearly ten years later, the world still needs mirrors for examining what it means for all sorts of animals to exist in one space, and we luckily have a rabbit and fox who know something about that.

At the start of this film, Nick and Judy are still early into their official partnership, and not everyone's sold on this whole idea of a fox and a bunny working on the police force--let alone as partners. And frankly, Nick and Judy themselves are still trying to convince themselves that it's not just wishful thinking.

Meanwhile, Zootopia is fast approaching the centennial celebration of the device that allows for the distinct climate districts in the city. Everyone knows that this invention happened to coincide with a deadly reptile attack, which is why there are no reptiles in Zootopia. And so when a certain blue serpent slithers onto the scene, everyone is nervous--except of course, a soft-hearted rabbit and the shrewd fox she drags along for the ride. If they want to prove to everyone that they belong on the force, they'll have to figure out what exactly happened 100 years ago and how to tell the world.

The nucleus of this film is Gary De'Snake, brought to life brilliantly by Ke Huy Quan. He is darn near the cutest reptile ever put to film--and also woefully underused. A lot of Judy and Nick's revelations about reptiles tend to be fueled more by conversations they have about him than actions he takes himself--you really want to see more of the snake.

A few parts of this film feel like they were edited for broadcast. This is another one of those movies where they obviously did a lot more research and made a lot more drawings than they needed to. That's all good and fine for worldbuilding, but the film feels a little crowded with cameos or one-off characters. Too many faces from the first movie wanted to make sure you remembered they were there.

The animation team builds on the playground of the first film--we were absolutely overdue for a marine-mammal section of Zootopia. But it's not just that the animal metropolis makes for some stunning vistas. We get to dive into the wheels and gears of this animal kingdom, and almost always while we're on the run. This film takes us on so many roller coasters that could only exist in this world.

A part of me wants to give this film a tepid review simply because I'm scared of what it represents. Particularly in the wake of last year's Moana 2 tumor, I'll always be hesitant to sign off on any Disney Animated movie with a number in its title. (Seriously folks, if you are going to feed Toy Story 5, consider also checking out Pixar's Hoppers or Disney Animation's Hexed next year.)

But this sequel sidesteps what made the 2010 Pixar sequels so nauseating. This film's external conflict fits alongside a compelling internal conflict between the characters--and not like a ""Wreck-it Ralph is being forced to resolve some attachment anxiety that he definitely didn't have in the last movie"" kind of conflict. Judy and Nick have some of the slickest verbal repartee of any animated pairing, but this kind of writing is even more important.

Nick and Judy are in conflict here, yes, but the film finds the optimal balance. Their mismatched viewpoints generate real tension between them and put their viability as a partnership into question. Judy asserts ""The world will never be a better place until people are brave enough to do the right thing."" To which Nick returns, ""Sometimes being a hero doesn't make a difference."" But they're never so biting that you lose sight of what makes their friendship so endearing in the first place.

So if I am to be subjected to Encanto 2, perhaps they can at least take notes from this movie.",2,0,0.2248666239863423,0.9455,4
rw11003295,saolivaresm,7.0,2025-12-06,"A solid sequel that, however, fails to match its predecessor.","It's been nine long years since Zootopia captivated us, and this wait brings us a worthy sequel that retains all the good things about the original, even if it doesn't quite surpass its first installment. Even so, it's a delightful film to enjoy and laugh with the beloved animals of Zootopia once again.

Directed by Jared Bush, who also wrote the screenplay, and featuring the original voices from the first film, Judy and Nick follow the twisted trail of a mysterious reptile that arrives in Zootopia and turns the mammal metropolis upside down. To solve the case, they must go undercover in surprising new areas of the city, where their growing society will be tested like never before.

Zootopia 2 , the highly anticipated sequel, is a true gem, brimming with witty humor and profound messages for all ages. Building on that foundation, we find a film that delivers in all its narrative aspects, though it falls somewhat short in terms of originality. While it introduces new characters, it doesn't manage to revolutionize concepts as its predecessor did.

If we're talking about the effectiveness of this second installment in terms of entertainment and good times, the film more than delivers. It's a family pastime that manages to win over both adults and children, with dazzling Disney animation and a truly sensational soundtrack. Although the story is a bit longer, it has very funny moments that will keep you entertained in front of the screen.

It's an ingenious film that clearly conveys its messages. The fun spirit of the first installment is still present and supports Bush and Howard's vision. The new characters are charismatic, and Judy and Nick continue to evoke emotions throughout their story, this time with a more restrained tone, but just as effective in moving us as viewers.

I'm left with a satisfying, well-executed sequel that, while not surpassing its predecessor in terms of excitement and originality, is more than enough to make Zootopia 2 a truly delightful spectacle that leaves us with a joyful feeling. We find a story full of nuances to tell, and it delivers a powerful social message as the credits roll.",3,2,0.3338087395696091,0.9968,4
rw10983260,Alexdisney23,10.0,2025-11-27,Disney Animation still got it. Best Sequel Ever!,"Here's an example of how a sequel can be better than original: Zootopia 2 takes the best from the first movie as a whole lot more. New characters and introducing Gary De'snake he could be our best friend or a sneaky suspect.

Seems all Walt Disney Animation Studios had to do was take 9 years to make this movie, with work on it beginning in 2017 and have a plan for it, which sadly was not the case with Frozen II.

-9 years after the original, Zootopia 2 delivers a heartfelt sequel that captures the magic of Nick Wilde and Judy Hopps' partnership while building genuine romantic tension between the beloved duo.

In my view Zootopia 2 actually way better than the first. No seriously, I mean it, especially when seeing how well-made and well-told it is even going into the film's final act, without giving anything away. The stakes are higher, the relationship between Judy and Nick gets challenged to new heights, the world of Zootopia is bigger with a crazier mind-blowing reveal that makes us look at the first film through a whole new lens. And the new characters that steal the show end up being Ke Huy Quan's Gary De'Snake (the heart of the film, IMHO), Patrick Warburton's Mayor Winddancer, and Andy Samberg, without saying too much about him. Also, the political elements and social commentary is thankfully still apart of the movie and its world like the first.

This is a 100%, genuine, absolutely no cap, 10 out of 10, 5 out of 5-star movie.

rw10987949,pranayjalvi,8.0,2025-11-29,Still adventurous and hilarious,"A recent run of sequels have been a disappointing affair for Disney, but not in the case of Zootopia 2. The sequel is still fresh, with new characters, silly humour and a fast paced story.

While the original introduced the mismatched friendship between an eternal optimist and a dyed-in-the-fur cynic, the sequel zooms in on what it takes for an odd-couple bond to survive the daily grind. As directed by Jared Bush and Byron Howard, their evolving dynamic gives the film a beating heart even as the usual computer-animated shenanigans unfold.

The central mystery driving the plot has faint echoes of the first film's conspiracy plot, but there are plenty of fresh, species-specific gags and blink-and-you-miss-it worldbuilding that'll continue to entertain on repeat viewing. The addition of new characters, especially Gray De Snake, was a showstealer.

More importantly, the emotional arc stays front and center. Continuing to explore themes of looking past stereotypes to find our shared, ahem, humanity, ""Zootopia 2"" ventures into new territory without losing its emotional footing. It shows us how trust and cooperation often hinge on small, brave choices made over and over again.

rw10991113,timeblank,8.0,2025-11-30,Sequel Worthy of the Original,"Disney's long awaited sequel to Zootopia proves that lightning can strike twice, delivering a vibrant return to the metropolis where predators and prey coexist in uneasy harmony. The film dazzles immediately with its beautiful animation, every frame brimming with detail that makes the city feel alive. At the heart of it all, Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde remain a dynamic duo, their banter and trust anchoring the story with warmth and wit. The narrative also packs a clever plot twist that reinvigorates the mystery, reminding audiences that appearances in Zootopia are rarely what they seem. Complementing the visuals and story, the music swells with energy, enhancing both comedic beats and suspenseful turns.

Yet the sequel isn't without its flaws. The hooded villain teased in the trailer either served as a deliberate fake out or was cut entirely, leaving viewers puzzled about Disney's marketing choices. Some of the comedic moments feel forced, as if the film is trying too hard to recapture the original's humor. And while the investigative sequences add depth, the pacing occasionally drags, slowing momentum when urgency should dominate.

Despite these hiccups, Zootopia 2 succeeds as a worthy continuation of the original. It expands the world, deepens Judy and Nick's partnership, and balances heart with intrigue. The film may stumble in its rhythm, but its artistry and emotional core shine through, making it a sequel that earns its place in Disney's canon.

This time around, Officer Judy Hopps and the ever-charismatic Nick Wilde are thrown into a mystery that's more intricate and daring than anything they've faced before.

rw11011371,hannahfloj,8.0,2025-12-08,Beginning of another Disney Renaissance?,"Just thinking this could be Disney's first best sequel they've ever put out? (excluding Pixar films) I am due another rewatch but I'm confident in saying it's better than the first.

The animation, particularly the lighting is beautiful. It shows how it's evolved leaps and bounds from 2016. The reptile underworld elements was great, pretty much what I imagined. I noticed the characters are a lot more expressive too with their animal characteristics, defiantly with Nick, he really shone.

Didn't expect for Gary to be the catalyst for Judy. Telling her not to weigh the whole world on her shoulders. And Nibbles, the catalyst for Nick to open up and not be scared to speak from the heart. Bringing them together in the end. Which was a gorgeous last act. My heart was in my mouth and then it was full. I could feel 12 year old me being all giddy and emotional. Beautiful.

A small moment I appreciated was Nick looking at himself adjusting his tie with a genuine smile on his face, reflecting back to being a scout and finally being part of a pack.

Perhaps Gary could of done with more screen time with Nick and Judy to make that bond more believable particularly with Nick to just solidify Gary's character. But there are a lot of other elements to balance and most importantly keeping Nick and Judy front and centre.

I love they re-used scrapped elements of the original plot like Nick and Judy being fugitives, the Tusk characters and seeing Nicks apartment. I've seen some scrapped stuff for this film as well that could easily work in the third. Now that Nick is opening up, It'd be nice to see more of his family background and where they could take that in the third if the story allows for it. And of course where they take Nick and Judy.

Certainly thankful for people like Byron Howard, Jared Bush and the team still being at Disney. Making good stories and pretty much stopping Disney animation from going under.

I always thought Zootopia 2 was something that should of happened along time ago, before Frozen 2. But here we are. It finally happened and It looks like it's not over either... Now there's going to be birds, and I for one can not wait.

Definitely one of the greatest Disney movies in years! It's pretty much on par with the first film. If I had to choose which one is better, I would still choose the first film, but overall both films are on the same level. While the first film focused more on the mystery itself, this movie mainly focuses on the relationship between Nick and Judy while they're also trying to figure out a mystery. The chemistry between the two is on a whole other level in this film. I was kinda shocked over how good it was, and you can tell that the movie is likely hinting towards something more romantic with that relationship, which I originally didn't expect to see. Anyway, even though the main part of the film is their relationship, the mystery of the film is also great. Just like with the first film, this one actually has a pretty good villain twist. The way how the villain is revealed and how he reveals himself out of nowhere without you expecting it was kinda crazy. The whole scene was very well done. Even with how good the villain reveal scene was, I do think that the final battle was a little underwhelming compared to the first film. The first film ending was Nick and Judy outsmarting the antagonist, while the film at first makes you think that Nick and Judy have no way out. While in this, it's kinda just them beating up the villain, then after beating him up, he just gets back up again, but then he gets taken down again a second time, but overall, I still think this was an amazing Disney film.

rw10989581,12NiuNiu6,7.0,2025-11-30,"Clichéd Plot Yet Addictive! Half Suspense Case, Half Judy-Nick Sugar Rush","As a sequel nine years in the making, frankly, this film isn't a dazzling surprise, but it's definitely a solid and competent work. Building on the worldview of its predecessor, it deepens the allegorical depth yet fails to break free from the ""middle-of-the-road"" trap common to sequels.

The main plot is refreshingly straightforward: the lynx family seeks to consolidate power by expanding Snow Town, but hides a dark history of stealing reptiles' ""climate wall"" patent and systematically expelling marginalized groups. A freak accident pulls Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde into this seemingly simple case, which actually involves historical sins. Unlike the first film's explicit critique of species prejudice, the sequel's conflict is more subtle-shifting from the binary opposition between carnivores and herbivores to the systemic erasure of marginalized groups by the mainstream. This upgraded allegory enhances the film's adult-oriented value but loses the freshness of the first encounter with Zootopia.

The visual and scene design is a top-tier highlight. The newly introduced Swamp Market is highly memorable, filled with reptilian residents unseen in central Zootopia and quirky rules like ""no casual touching"" and ""fish-only transactions."" Coupled with Disney's new ScaleTech scale system-allowing each of Gary's tens of thousands of blue scales to move independently-the market is transformed into the film's most vivid setting. The protagonists' fur texture, enhanced by the FurSim 3.0 hair system, is incredibly detailed, even capturing the realistic fluffiness as wind blows (Mayor Lionheart's fur is finally redeemed, haha), making the nine-year wait worthwhile.

Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde remain the soul of the film, with the creators perfectly catering to audience expectations. Their bond transcends a simple partnership, evolving into a spiritual connection where ""you understand my perseverance, and I protect your softness."" Sweet moments like Nick tugging Judy's ears and their instinctive protection of each other are utterly heartwarming, while their conflicting values add depth: Nick's desire for stability stems from childhood insecurity and fear of loss, making his line ""It's not worth dying for"" an act of protection rather than cowardice. Judy, eager to prove herself, finds her only believer in Nick, and the misunderstanding when this trust falters only strengthens their bond. Compared to their tentative first encounter, the sequel's emotional portrayal is more nuanced, with the bittersweet tension keeping audiences engaged.

Both returning and new characters shine. The comeback of Assistant Mayor Bellwether, Flash, and Gazelle is a nostalgic treat, with Flash's slow-motion driving still delivering comedic gold. Among new characters, Nibbles' down-to-earth charm is delightful, his dialect-style banter breaking the tense detective rhythm and drawing spontaneous laughter. The actor-turned-mayor, seemingly controlled by the lynx family, struggles between justice and self-interest before finally choosing the truth-subtly satirizing the co-option of politics by capital while retaining the character's moral complexity, a masterful example of ""non-stereotypical"" characterization.

The most poignant character is undoubtedly Pawbert, a tragic figure torn between fitting in with the protagonists and craving recognition from his indifferent family. His betrayal stems not from malice, but a desperate need to prove his worth to his father. Yet, even after imprisonment, he never receives his father's approval, left with only prison bars and family neglect. His deranged and conflicted gaze as he attacks Judy reveals a paranoia to prove his innocence, making him a tragic villain shaped by family alienation rather than pure evil.

However, its flaws are evident: the plot follows a predictable formula, with unimpressive suspense twists. Most developments are foreseeable-for instance, could the villain really be an obedient cop? How could things progress so smoothly? There must be a mole, and Pawbert aroused suspicion long before his confession.

If the first film was the ""establishment of Zootopia,"" this sequel is its ""repair."" It teaches us that true trust means choosing each other despite misunderstandings. While lacking in surprises, its solid execution makes it well worth watching.",2,1,0.13259402934727613,0.5257,4
rw10988331,YoungCriticMovies,6.0,2025-11-29,"Bigger and busier, this sequel can't recapture the original's spark","After the return of Bob Iger as Disney CEO, a pivot was made to make less quantity of content for the streamer Disney +, which had partially doomed his chosen successor Bob Chapek, and instead play it safe with sequels to beloved franchises. Thus, a greenlight was given for Moana 2 (2024), Toy Story 5 (2026), and Frozen 3 (2027). Among the anointed sequels to previous hits is Zootopia 2 (2025), which just hit theaters.

Zootopia 2 comes out nine years after the original, yet only a week has passed in the cinematic narrative. Newly anointed hero cops, Judy Hopps () and ex-con Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman), find that working together professionally is more challenging than expected. They are roped in to yet another conspiracy, when a snake (Ke Huy Quan) - banished and feared animals in Zootopia - pulls off a heist at a gala. Judy and Nick chase down the leads and while pulling at the threads, discover that not all is at it seems with Zootopia's past.

Zootopia 2 reunites Jared Bush and Byron Howard from the first film, with Bush as the sole screenwriter. To have a singular screenwriter for an animated family film is quite unusual, as one usually gets a barrage of angles and perspectives to try and fine-tune the story to be as harmless and sellable as possible. Zootopia (2016) impressed with a complex mystery and a tangled web of characters within a lived-in world. Pulling off this complicated storytelling so that both young children and their parents stayed entertained was quite a feat. With Zootopia 2 we again get a complex mystery and expanded view of the rich world, yet the film also falls into the most glaring sequel trope: telling the same story again, only bigger.

The fine-tuning of the first film gets lost in the shuffle as Bush and Byron overstuff Zootopia 2 with more characters, settings, and narrative twists and turns. It is a risky move that could alienate the youngest viewers, as even adults have to stay focused to track the narrative. Meanwhile, character work is diluted as we are introduced to an array of colorful new characters, crammed alongside the old ones. This ironically blunts the message of the original by simplifying characters to one-dimensional cliches instead of taking the complexity of each individual.

The first Zootopia had a powerful message regarding stereotypes, racism, and judging people by their family or appearance. Its sequel doubles down on this subject matter, yet introduces a more ambitious concept to introduce to kids: gentrification. The main plot revolves around the exclusion of reptiles from the mammal world (another variation of herbivore and carnivore confrontation of the first film), and how mammals wish to expand their ""tundra"" neighborhood into the marshland district, displacing the reptiles living there. It is a fascinating experiment to see if children understand the complexities at play in gentrification: from developer rights, to land ownership, and the pricing out or ""inhospitable"" habitat replacing original establishments. It is too specific a point to explore in a family film, which is already overstuffed and bloated. Perhaps with a better focus and less overextension, the subject could have been broached in a clear and gentle manner.

Even though it plays it as safe as it can, essentially delivering the same film again with a different coat of paint, Zootopia 2 is still an enjoyable romp. It does go way overboard on the pun humor of the first, to a point that I was oversaturated 20 minutes in by how many jokes you could put the word ""zoo"" in. Yet, the great voice cast, led by Goodwin and Bateman, who bring their A-game, helps elevate the more emotional scenes and make the cringier ones more digestible. The animation quality is also astounding, once again showcasing Disney's computer animators as the best in the industry. There are many more scenes involving water - a notorious element to animate - and its interaction with different furs, hairs, and coats, which had me in awe.

In the end, Zootopia 2 is a harmless repackaged version of the original. It works as a fainter echo of the first's blast, yet proves enjoyable nonetheless. The narrative suffers from overstuffing, and the plot might prove too complicated for younger viewers this time around. Nevertheless, for a benign time at the movies, this sequel will help pass the time amiably.",4,4,0.17986775651249337,0.9963,2

rw10987381,SalJ-4,8.0,2025-11-29,An amazing surprise,"""So yes, Disney! Honestly, I was surprised when I watched the movie because, given Disney's recent track record, anyone would be discouraged. But to everyone's surprise, it turned out to be a movie that SURPASSED the original in many aspects and is much more complete than the original. I love that they continue to develop Judy and Nick's relationship, as they have a good working dynamic because while Judy tends to be more impulsive, Nick is more concerned with security. The relationship continues to develop very well and makes these two protagonists more human.

The movie touches on themes like discrimination and prejudice in a very similar way to the original, but I think in this movie they focus more on the fact that no matter how many good deeds you've done, many people won't change their perception of you. This theme is handled very well in the movie because they show that Judy and Nick, being so different from each other and being a novice couple, aren't going to convince everyone that they're good cops, even if they've done great feats in the past.

As for the animation and music, I have no complaints because everyone still looks incredible with that palette of vibrant colors and those contrasts. The humor is very good since they show that fart jokes aren't necessary to make people laugh, and the secondary cast is incredible because they give each animal a really funny characteristic and use them for the jokes.

The villains are a threat from the beginning of the movie, not like in the previous one, and although there's a plot twist at the end, it's a different plot twist from the previous movie because the villain does bad things and creates obstacles for the protagonists.

The fan service is very present but in a very organic way for the jokes. As the only negative point, the snake and beaver characters have little development and although they're important for the plot, they quickly take a backseat.

This movie reminds me a lot of some movies like Shrek 2 or The Bad Guys, since instead of regressing the characters and doing the same plot as the original movie, they bet on continuing to develop their characters in an organic way.""",3,1,0.2201442307692308,0.9942,2
rw10998474,robloxworld,8.0,2025-12-04,"While not better than the first movie, it is pretty much on part with it","There's so many things I love about this sequel, and also so many things that could've been better or taken a different approach, but overall there's nothing in this movie that by any means would be bad, in fact it has multiple beautiful character dynamics to Nick and Judy's relationship and expands on the world of Zootopia heavily.

My biggest concers I would say are 3 things. The first is that Z2's Nick is pretty nonchalant about everything compared to Z1's Nick, especially since the first and second movie only covers a one week gap, so he should be still pretty much under the events of the first case, and atleast care about being an officer, same with everyone else. The statement that ""Many animals question wether you are a good duo or not in the first place"", like they saved the whole city a week ago, but sure. I feel like atleast a two-month gap was needed, hopefully Zootopia 3 does a bigger timeskip.

The second is that this movie moves a lot faster than the previous one. It is exactly why I think it's not better than Zootopia 1 because in that, the case was revolved around a big mystery, with some sudden twists and turns, while in this movie they could've gone two ways, either focus on Nick and Judy's relationship, or the case, and they decided to do both, but what that end up doing is that it was kind of a mixed bag between teamwork/possible love and uncovering the mystery.

The third and final concern of mine was that nearly all the action sequences felt forced besides the antidote, Red Line run scenes and the Car chase at the beginning.

But what I loved, and I mean LOVED LOVED mostly makes me forget about the not so good things, which are obviously THE TALK scene, which was honestly (and I might be in the minority) was everything and more than a kiss scene could've caused, and how the team overkilled the animation this time around, it was so beautiful and that is where the budget clearly shows.

It's clear that Zootopia 3 is going to be a thing, and I hope they go out with a bang and do it in a Toy Story 3 way, and not make a cashgrab choice in a Toy Story 4-5 way.

Overall Zootopia 2 worth the 9 years wait, but if I may add a 4th thing I didn't like was that how much they made us wait for this needed sequel~",1,0,0.21465773809523805,0.9978,0

rw10991468,KompetenterMedic,9.0,2025-12-01,Natural selection done right,"The sequel manages something that many follow ups struggle with. It grows naturally out of the first film and builds on everything that made that world entertaining. The city feels even more alive this time. Every species moves in a way that reflects its real traits, yet remains expressive enough to carry emotion. The animation keeps that balance consistently and gives the world a vibrant energy that never fades.

The comedy reaches a new level of subtlety. The animal based jokes build on what already worked so well in the first film, adding layers of detail, background gags and quick visual ideas. Scenes like the streaming parody overflow with references and small moments that almost demand a pause to catch them all. The film never stops to spotlight its humor. It simply trusts the audience to notice it, which makes the world feel clever, lively and full of personality.

The story takes a small step toward complexity while remaining accessible for children. It does not try to be more than it is, yet it avoids underestimating its audience. The characters follow believable emotional paths. Their development feels natural. The dialogue stays warm and clear without drifting into simplicity. The film understands that adults are part of the experience. It includes humor and emotional beats that work on more than one level. It avoids the common problem of treating a children's film as something that only children should care about.

The sequel respects its predecessor while quietly surpassing it. It keeps the charm, the visual creativity and the playful worldbuilding of the original, but sharpens nearly every aspect. It remains a children's film in tone and structure, yet it never leaves older viewers behind. Instead, it invites them into a world that feels thoughtful, entertaining and full of life.",2,1,0.19770879526977087,0.9821,2

rw10987295,dorMancyx,7.0,2025-11-29,Hopps and Wilde,"This is a much better sequel than Inside Out 2 and Moana 2, not just cheaply appending to the concepts or adding new characters. Zootopia 2 features a new class of animals who bear weighty mysteries of the city, new territories with creative crafts to the lifestyle of anthropomorphic animals, and new conflicts, realistic and emotional, for one of Disney's best protagonist duo. The upgrades in industrial and artistic powers really shine through the action scenes, of which fluency, sequencing, plot relevance, and even the texture of wetted fur speak the meticulousness of production. Furthermore, the overarching detective slash adventure storyline feels well-constructed and well-paced, with every ""click"" of the puzzle reasonable and well-earned through the buildup. Other than innovation, the movie calls back to fan-favorite elements of the first such as lines, characters, and cinematic Easter eggs - the audience of my watch laughed the hardest during the Ratatouille and Shining references. Yet also like the first, there is a sense of over-fullness with the film trying to compact all its aspects into one narrative, but personally I wouldn't mind the overflowing of stimuli and ingenuity for a piece of entertainment.

I'd like to first sincerely compliment the writers' effort at making Judy and Nick's dispute neither superficial nor melodramatic, while balancing both their likability and linking their growth back to the moral of the story. However, since Zootopia is one of Disney's best works and the duo one of their best protagonists, standards are high for these two. My main problem is that Judy loses her ""dumb bunny"" traits in this movie and most of the time she knows too well where to go; when her karma of recklessness hits, it's already too late in the movie for any substantive period of reflection. On the other hand, Nick loses his traits as""sly fox,"" as he essentially follows Judy the entire film despite life endangerment; there's not a single instance where he steps up and figures a clever way out of the immediate trouble. As for the romantic confession slash reconnecting scene, the manner at which they flash out their traumas and yearnings is comedic and anti-cliche, but the content and the effect is still very much Disney formulaic.

The film shines brightest in its thoughtful expansion of the core relationship between Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde, granting them deeper, more emotionally resonant arcs that justify the film's existence beyond mere spectacle. While the sharp humor, clever animal puns, and political undercurrents remain intact and relevant, the introduction of compelling new characters-particularly the standout Gary De'Snake-further enriches the already vibrant megalopolis. Although the central mystery occasionally feels a touch overstuffed with competing subplots, the movie is ultimately a confident and ambitious continuation that retains the original's thematic heart, making it an excellent and entirely necessary entry in the franchise.",3,1,0.25498737373737373,0.9908,2

rw10986530,yoyoh7h0123,9.0,2025-11-29,"Finally, the Disney we remember has returned.","Given the declining quality of Disney's recent animated films-especially their sequels-I was genuinely worried about whether Zootopia 2 could live up to the standard set by the first movie. However, those concerns completely disappeared once I actually stepped into the theater and finished watching the film. Zootopia 2 avoids the trap of rehashing old ideas. Instead, it introduces a brand-new mystery that expands the worldbuilding in ways the original never explored. I particularly appreciated how the filmmakers used the progression of the plot to guide viewers, through Nick and Judy, into completely new areas of the city. Storytelling and worldbuilding work hand in hand, enhancing one another rather than adding unnecessary elements just for the sake of expansion.

I also enjoyed how much of the humor is built upon the natural characteristics of each animal. Because the audience already understands these traits, the subtle jokes land even better. And although sequels often need to bring back familiar characters, Zootopia 2 handles their return surprisingly well. Many beloved characters reappear in ways that feel organic, and some even play crucial roles in advancing the story-something not all sequels manage to pull off.

Of course, the film's visual design is another highlight. The animals in each ecological zone behave, speak, and even choose professions in ways that closely reflect their real-world species. Every time the story enters a new environment, the screen is filled with layers of details and Easter eggs-so many that a single viewing likely isn't enough to appreciate everything. Moreover, the shifts in musical style subtly reveal which real-world groups the so-called ""reptile"" characters are meant to represent. This clever use of musical language further shows how thoughtfully crafted the film's symbolism and narrative techniques are.

Beneath its animated surface, the film also touches on issues such as racial tensions, the oppression of minority groups, and the structures of capitalism. By the final act, it even invites the audience to reflect on a deeper question: even if Zootopia is meant to be an animal utopia, can it truly escape the influence of politics and economic power?

Overall, I genuinely enjoyed this film. It is funny, visually captivating, and successfully expands its world within a limited runtime. Although the ending could have revealed a bit more about the world's lore, the careful planning behind the story direction and worldbuilding is still clear-not at all like last year's Moana 2, which felt driven primarily by commercial interests.",2,1,0.16208301502419156,0.9929,2
rw10985313,judrfdd,7.0,2025-11-28,"Not bad, but derivative, and weaker than the first film.","Not bad, but derivative, and weaker than the first film.

The humor is weaker, there are no strong, memorable moments, and there are many repetitions from the first film. The strong characters of the first film (among the new ones) are absent. The central story is the same as the first film, nothing new. The same template again = the first film. Overall, it's not bad, but it doesn't have the same grip as the first film.

A sterile cartoon, which in many places is a copy of the first film, but weaker. If the film does well at the box office, we can expect a rash of sequels, duplicating each other with minimal changes. I don't quite understand why they spent so much time making it. The plot isn't as complex, and the city's depiction is simpler than in the first film. And the brief glimpse of the ""water"" world isn't worth the time spent on its creation.

I would like to mention the ""picture"" separately. It is much simpler than the first part, I don't understand the comments about its improvement and that they showed more. Chamberness= almost the entire cartoon takes place indoors, with a minimum number of characters in the background. Exceptions = swamps and chase scenes. Watch the first part, where there are many more open locations and more characters in the locations. The second part looks more low-budget. Remember the large-scale scenes in the second part, where dozens of characters are shown in the background. Where close-ups are shown.

rw10987443,Maxime-39,3.0,2025-11-29,"A visually stunning sequel, but narratively unbalanced and emotionally disappointing","I wanted to love Zootopia 2. I truly did. The first film meant a lot to me, so much that it genuinely influenced my life choices back in 2016 (I even ended up working ""for the mouse"" for a couple of years afterward). That movie had heart, nuance, and emotional resonance.

This sequel... left me uneasy.

Spoilers below

The biggest disappointment for me was Pawbert being revealed as a villain. I was hoping for at least one redeeming member of the Lynxley family to break the cycle - whether it was Kitty, Cattrick, or heck... even Milton. Instead, the movie portrays every single one of them as corrupt or malicious, which by extension makes the entire species of lynx look that way since they are virtually the only ones we see. That lack of balance really soured the ending for me.

And then there's Judy. She doesn't truly apologizes to Nick after he risks his life to save her. She doesn't reflect on her mistakes or acknowledge the danger she put him in. That scene felt strangely hollow, especially considering how emotionally intelligent the first film was.

For the first time, I genuinely found it hard to connect with Judy.

rw10982705,naroiden,2.0,2025-11-27,Illogicalpia 2,"After an amazing first movie which I rewatched a lot for years I have no idea how they could screw up in this sequel so hard. First of all I will state there is no nostalgia factor for me to still like the first movie. Since the movie was released my taste changed a lot so I stopped liking what I once liked but the first movie is such a proper movie I still have lots of good reasons to like the movie, but when it comes to 2nd movie it is just very bad.

The story doesn't progress coherently compared to the first one. In the first movie events unfold naturally and characters do what ""they need to do"" but in this movie events really don't make sense. To make the review spoiler-free all I can write is they enforce events to happen and the nonsense level of events that mostly happens are no different than watching Looney Tunes, while in the first movie whatever happened happened in the common sense way you would expect from real life so it made story progression coherent and naturally flowing. I have no idea if they used an AI to write the whole script and let the AI decide how the scenes should be. I kept saying ""why did you do X"", ""what is the point of Y"" while watching most of the movie. This also means dialogues are not coherent either so I kept saying ""what you said doesn't make sense at all"" and when what they said didn't make sense they kept saying their lines from the first movie and it made ""why and when they said it didn't make sense"" then. Not to mention the scene where a random animal having his body hairs cut to make his body look muscular like Rambo but due to a nonsense ""accident"" that is not the most but one of the scenes that don't make sense at all most of his body hair magically gone but the body hairs that are left forms into ""breasts"" so he is like ""wow I liked it"" by trying to behave like a stereotypical woman. What the hell was that scene? No wonder people watched the movie like watching a UFO landing in front of them and people were sitting there as if they were listening to their boss complain about them.

The story is not interesting and doesn't make sense either due to the established facts in the first movie, so ignoring fundamental facts to establish nonsense situation made the whole story fall apart. Compared to the first movie the story was not interesting at all, at most it had the quality of an ordinary TV series episode that doesn't add anything to the main story.

All I wanted to watch was Nick and Judy's partnership as a police keep going on in a new adventure, and it would be interesting to see Nick being a cop but honestly there was barely an adventure to begin with and we barely watched they being a cop. Instead of Nick and Judy making their bond stronger, just to obey a nonsense drama formula to develop movies they just made the character behave out of character way and just to enforce the story in a lazy way they basically made the movie very soulless. You would expect Nick and Judy to have such a relationship in the first movie when they just met and started to work on the case together for the first time, not when their bond is supposed to be strong in the 2nd movie since they are partners now but they got along better when they first met doesn't make sense. The whole character dynamic didn't make sense at all.

While Judy's character kept okay, Nick's character is butchered so he lost his ""clever fox who is cool and indifferent"" persona and was mostly replaced by how Judy was in the first movie. Seriously most of what Nick did was what I would expect Judy to do in the movie. Yes many people likes Nick but it doesn't mean Nick should also do what we would expect Judy to do so people can watch Nick more. We were not interested in Nick in the first movie for how he looked like or the fact that he is a fox.

For example why the first movie was good is that it is filled with tons of good ideas so the movie never goes empty, boring and non-interesting ""visual dilly dally"". They kept pouring interesting things to watch. In 2nd movie they could barely fill most scenes with something coherent. They had no idea what to do so they kept using ideas from the first movie so it seemed like trying to force yourself to eat an ancient pizza made a decade ago. Just because they overused ideas from the first movie things didn't make sense for another reason. However there was only one part of the movie that actually seemed like written by a human being and that section of the movie was okay and felt like how 1st movie was like but unfortunately that part of the movie was like 5% of the movie and that is why I gave this movie 2/10 instead of a solid 1/10.

In the end this movie is a very unworthy sequel for an amazing first movie. I don't think I would care to watch a 3rd movie. Disney had better turn Zootopia into a TV series idea or adapt it into a decent open-world video game with random crimes to deal with besides a main story, otherwise I see no decent future for this IP for they just killed it with this movie.",5,13,0.15679870129870135,0.9891,4

I came up with a litany of complaints to combat the bizarrely positive reviews the film is receiving. In short, nothing in this film works. It commits egregious sins in terms of storytelling and character development. Absurd logical leaps are required to make sense of the puerile plot, and the plot holes render the whole as airy as a bubble bath. Nothing about it is tight, sensical or pleasing to a discerning viewer. If you shut your brain off completely and watch it while in a daze, only vaguely paying attention to the flashing colors and ecstatic energy of the animation, and if you purposefully forget about physics, common sense and other such normal concerns of the human brain, you might conceivably derive some enjoyment out of it I suppose.

It's like Elio. Only worse. The more you think about it, the less sense it makes. First off, why did they separate the two movies by only a week? You're telling me that in a week, Zoootopia forgot that the mayor was corrupt. And in that time, the herbivore and carnivore relations were perfectly settled. Merrywether was tried and convicted. Nick completed police training and was assigned to Judy. Nick and Judy were assigned to a special unit. The damage they caused in the first movie was repaired. They got a new mayor - all within ONE WEEK? Why not set the film several months later? Nick and Judy are already having trouble as a team (in their first week). Nick did not act like it was his first day on the job the way he strutted around as if he owned the place.

While the thematic exploration may not cut as deeply as the original's allegories, the film still engages with thoughtful ideas in a way that feels accessible and sincere.

Visually, the movie remains impressive, with playful details, expressive animation, and lively crowd scenes that make Zootopia feel more alive than ever. The pacing occasionally loosens in the midsection, and a few story beats feel slightly less tight than the first film's mystery-driven structure, but these are small drawbacks in an otherwise confident sequel.

Overall, Zootopia 2 is a highly enjoyable and skillfully executed continuation that may not be quite as groundbreaking, but undeniably excellent and worthy of being one of Disney's best movies (or sequel films) in years.",1,1,0.30102578580839456,0.9963,2
rw10987292,auroramoon-94827,9.0,2025-11-29,A Sequel Worth the Nine-Year Wait,"Sometimes a movie grows up with you. The first Zootopia was one of those for me. I watched it with my sister years ago, and by the time the credits rolled, we were both wishing with all our hearts for a sequel. It became one of those comfort films that stayed with me-funny, warm, and unexpectedly meaningful.

And now, after nine long years, we finally have the sequel we waited for. I didn't expect much, especially after the trailers. Honestly, I watched it almost bracing myself for disappointment. But what I got instead... was something that felt like a gift. A reminder of why I fell in love with the first movie in the first place.

The animation is once again fantastic. The city is as vibrant and imaginative as ever, and exploring more of its districts was such a treat. The humor landed perfectly-the animal puns, the movie references, the quick visual gags. I was laughing far more than I expected.

The plot surprised me most. It felt stronger and even darker than the first movie, in the best way. I want the Zootopia franchise to keep exploring these deeper themes-kids' movies can and should teach something meaningful while entertaining us. And it was twisty! Sure, some people guessed the villain early (I did too), but somewhere along the way I actually started to trust them. And then-BOOM. A full Hans-level betrayal. My jaw actually dropped. I hoped they'd deliver a twist like the first film, and I'm so glad they did.

The characters were a joy. Judy and Nick are unstoppable, clever, and more dynamic than ever. The new characters-Gary, Nibbles, the Horse Mayor-brought humor, comfort, and absolute cuteness. Seeing Mr. Big's granddaughter, Gazelle's choreography, Flash's last moment support, Bellwether's little escape attempt... all of it was fun and wholesome.

But my favorite part? Judy and Nick's depth. They have several genuinely emotional moments together. I'm not even a hardcore shipper (just a casual one), but I was screaming, crying, bawling for them. Judy did get a bit annoying at times, but her heart is as fierce as ever. Meanwhile, Nick had my love from the first second-wiser, calmer, and honestly the perfect partner and cop. Their bond, whatever you want to call it, healed my inner child. It was exactly what I needed.

The message of the film is beautifully done and extremely relevant. The monologues feel sincere and grounded. The film talks about understanding one another, working through differences, and learning to express ourselves. And yes, the classic ""don't judge a book by its cover"" theme still hits home. I will forever pray that animated films keep delivering messages as well as this.

Final take: I watched it with zero expectations and finished it loving it even more than the first. Sequels like this-and Inside Out 2-make me believe in that old Disney-Pixar magic again. My heartfelt thanks to the entire team for creating a sequel that made me feel like a child all over again. You brought back a piece of magic I thought I'd lost.",3,1,0.2472844643619291,0.9995,2

The moment that scene kicked in, I swear, if I were actually in the theater, I would've walked out immediately. It felt like Disney threw in random ""edgy"" content just to look cool, and it totally missed the mark.

rw10986036,yassi_lo,6.0,2025-11-29,Poorly Written But Beautiful,"(I'm by no means good at writing reviews so bare with me)

Before I get into my critique, I'd like to compliment this movie's stellar visuals, incredible voice acting, and wonderful sound design. However, the plot of this movie is quite nonsensical and amateurish. This sequel is something akin to ""Frozen 2"", ""Moana 2"", and ""Rio 2"". This whole movie was very clearly a ploy to sell merchandise. It abandons quality and pumps up the theatrics.

I was very nervous going into this film and having seen it twice now, to say I'm disappointed would be an understatement. I'm a forever lover of animation and a major fan of the first ""Zootopia"" film which I've rewatched over 2 dozen times. This sequel is an underwhelming, confusing, and poorly written follow up to the legacy of the original. Just because it wasn't COMPLETELY unbearable to watch does not make it good and I refuse to lower my standards in light of Disney's recent struggles. How can this be the standard Disney has come to? Why is this weak quality of writing what kids of today are forced to grow up with?

While the first film features Judy actively searching for clues, using her detective skills and logic to solve the case, this movie force feeds Judy (and all the other characters for that matter) every clue and coincidence they could ever need.

Nick and Judy happened to get access to a vehicle to chase down a criminal they were pursuing. Judy happened to see a snake slither out of the van she overtook because the driver happened to fall unconscious at the wheel. Judy happened to turn on her TV at the perfect time to see the same catering van. Nick happened to drop his earbud in the perfect location to see shed skin. Judy happened to find a highly knowledgeable beaver via her podcast that also happened to have connections to Mr. Big's daughter. Gary happened to lose his fanny pack and it happened to be washed out with Nick and Judy. Judy happened to match a flower that a mountain goat happened to spit out to a set of matches. Judy happened to be saved from falling because Pawsley was there. A guard happened to leave a mop near Nibbles. Flash happened to drive in front of Judy as she was about to be shot. I could go on and on but you get the idea. None of the characters here really struggled at any point in the movie. I understand it's a cartoon but cartoons also need to be believable. There are no real hurdles for the characters to grow from or overcome, it all reads as ""I was in the right place at the right time"".

One of this film's other major faults is that it features many, many illogical scenes, especially near the end of the story.

The whole plot has the characters follow the shedding skin of a snake? Why is this snake constantly molting? Does it need medical attention? Later on, why would the mountain goats disclose to complete strangers that there was a snake hideout in their honeymoon lodge? Near the end, this movie tries to convince you that a snake (which is a cold blooded reptile that cannot generate its own body heat by the way) can survive subzero temperatures if a scarf is partially wrapped around its torso. It tries to convince you that a limping lynx that fell from a large height is capable of running faster than a snowplow as it bulldozes through the bushy walls of a labyrinth. It also tries to convince you that a city that has been buried under snow for over 100 years not only has no mold, no still air, and no visible structural damage aside for faint cracks but also has functioning lights that can all be switched on via turning a single light bulb (suggesting the whole town has a single series circuit). But the most egregious example of their failure was to feature modern crayons and coloured markers in a century old city. This movie also established that tortoises are incredibly slow yet in the flashback we see the maid was able to get a PIECE OF PAPER out of a fireplace before it ignited.

The new characters were flat and greatly underdeveloped for how much screen time they got, with no real interests or flaws (unless they benefited the plot). Judy and Nick were not shown going to therapy enough to justify the 2 minutes of monologuing at each other while standing perfectly still. The lizard fella was useless and we spent way too much time on him for him not to benefit the plot at all. This movie kept building to points without them ever coming to anything, we jump around the city and get nowhere.

This movie reused nearly every joke from the first movie as if to say ""Remember when it was funny the first time we did it? Look how funny it is when we repeat it!"" It includes characters from the previous movie but they barely benefited the story. The twist villain was very predictable.

This movie has no strong emotional beats, it rushes through everything, and it shoves its message down everyone's throats. It also takes a very lighthearted tone and uses Nick's traumas as a punchline. It nearly completely removed itself from the relatable realities of city living or Judy's strong identity as a cop.

Nothing in this sequel was established in the first movie.

There is so much I haven't even touched upon in this long winded rambling... just... this is exhausting, this movie really is barely passable.

Much like in ""Moana 2"" the post credit scene suggests there'll be a 3rd movie, I can only clasp my hands in prayer that it'll be at least slightly better than this one.

I just loved Gary ""de Snake"". He was adorable and definitely my favorite character this go-around. I never expected that I'd fall for Gary in such a hard way but his story really touched me.

That said, I did find the first half a bit slow, not bad mind you, just a bit slower than I found the first half of the original Zootopia. But the second half definitely picks up the pace, ramping up the excitement and delivering some real thrills.

The villain is much harder to spot this time around, and when you find out who it is, I was genuinely surprised. It was a clever reveal that had me rethinking earlier clues.

The film's song is good and catchy; it's been stuck in my head since I left the theater. And Judy and Nick's relationship is very heartfelt, adding real emotional depth to their partnership. I still hope to see more of Nick's back story in a future sequel and learn more about his family and what happened to them. I believe there's a heartbreaking story to be told here.

There's a whole bunch of references in this film that will fly over most kids' heads (many non-Americans too, I expect), but adults should get a kick out of them. They're witty nods that make it even more enjoyable on multiple levels.

Its message is very tender and heartfelt; at no point in time is it preachy, and I believe it's something everyone should find acceptable, no matter your background.

The film does have some shocking moments, so it might be best for older children, but it's nowhere close to how I'm reading some make it out in other reviews here. If your child is that frail, I'd definitely recommend they avoid classic Disney and Don Bluth animated films, as they're far darker and more violent than anything that happens in Zootopia 2.

The animation is stunning, and I appreciated being able to see more of the city, especially Nick's own apartment. It really fleshes out the world in a beautiful way.

As for the critics who've left poor reviews, I don't understand exactly what they expect? This is a fun, family-friendly sequel that builds on the original without reinventing the wheel. Maybe they're just jaded.

If you were a fan of the first film, you'll certainly love this one. And for everyone else, if you have a heart, you will enjoy this too. It's definitely a movie for children and adults alike.",2,1,0.20223004694835678,0.9987,4

Despite their success in the previous movie in foiling a citywide conspiracy which went right to the very top, water buffalo police chief Bogo is determined to keep them at the most junior level. And, guess, what, they discover another conspiracy. But does anyone believe them?

This sequel treads some very similar ground to its predecessor but, for the most part does so well. There are some entertaining new characters (the ZeBros made me chuckle), some great new locations, and some nice life lessons about trust, betrayal, not pre-judging, family etc.

On the not-so-good side, let me list:
Chief Bogo really irritates me. I know it's a kids film, but his character's stubborn insistence in suppressing Hopps' ambition means he's not a very credible boss. That, or he's a sexist/speciesist character who shouldn't be in that job.

The film is packed to the rafters with gags. Unfortunately the pace is so frenetic that many of them fly by so fast that they're gone before you have the chance to register them. An exception to this is the point when they enter a snow covered hedge maze. As the camera lifts up to reveal it, the score delivers the ominous chords familiar from Kubrick's The Shining. And...
A number of the gags, like that one, are clearly pitched at adults, not kids.

rw10980521,guangyingzhechn,8.0,2025-11-26,Not every case is meant to save the world,"After nine years of anticipation, *Zootopia 2* surpassed 300 million in pre-sales in mainland China before its official release. Maintaining the high production standards of its predecessor, the film boasts stunning visuals, lifelike animals, and an authentic ecological portrayal. Zootopia has become the ideal utopia for animals, and the sequel expands its map to include tropical rainforests, tundra regions, and deserts, presenting a more complete worldview step by step.

The birth of any popular product is closely linked to the times. The current world is in a period of transition and economic decline, and the second installment of Zootopia has also abandoned individual heroism, highlighting the importance of collectivism. Director Niu raised a question: not every case is a question of saving the world, and at that time, Officer Judy Rabbit did not understand the meaning of the leader's statement.

In the following plot, the appearance of Gary the Snake triggers a history in Zootopia about the ""climate wall"". Reptiles are the core factor in this case, but before watching, everyone thought the snake would be the villain. However, it turns out that he really needs to be protected. This reversed setting is very exciting and also reflects the current divided American social environment.

The story reaches its climax, with fox Nick and rabbit Judy suffering serious injuries to Director Niu. The newly appointed Mayor Ma of this city is actually a puppet regime supported by Lin Xuexing, which is similar to the plot of the previous installment. Does this also indicate that the animals in Zootopia tend to lie down more comfortably, and no one actually pays attention to who will be the leader.

The core revelation of the second part is the disappearance and lack of attention to the peripheral areas of Zootopia. These forgotten populations, like the Gary snakes, are naturally marked with cold-blooded traits and are not accepted by the public. They can only silently contribute, and Zootopia is far from them in any way, reflecting the current social situation in the United States. In my opinion, Hollywood has its own independent existence, which is exactly the opposite of Dongda. We always sing and praise, and daring to expose requires courage or being labeled as artistic.

At the end of the story, the ""Climate Wall"" is revealed. It turns out that all of this was invented by Gary Snake Granny, and it is also the key to the formation of Zootopia. Its existence allows different animals to survive and reproduce in different climates. When the rabbit and fox face unprecedented life and death choices, Judy, the rabbit, remembered what Director Niu said. Their highly praised partners are a mutually exclusive group in the animal kingdom, with infinite charm mainly due to their adherence to justice and their strong sense of hooliganism

There is a detail here. At the beginning of the movie, Nick and Judy are still living their old lives. Judy did not lead the life of a leader after solving a big case in the previous film, and she is always focused on the case. Nick's life is still chaotic, and he occasionally makes some extra money, which also shows the nature of animals. The creator handled this aspect very appropriately.

This detective duo understands that accepting each other and everything about each other is the cornerstone of sincere emotions, rather than being heroes. This coincides with the theme of the story, which is to accept every different self and integrate to achieve harmony. In the current world, if we give everyone in ordinary positions the respect and living space they deserve, society will be beautiful. Chinese people often say that when people gather together, what they eat is not important, and the principle of important reunion is the same. What transcends material possessions is the true understanding of profession.

If a society is dominated by ""unwritten rules"", awards must be paid for and there must be leadership relationships. ""Under the table articles"" are always the threshold that cannot be bypassed. This is not a harmonious and prosperous era, but a deformed society, especially for the vast majority of ordinary people or animals that are never seen in animal cities. They also have their own families and the right to live.

The themes of Hollywood movies are very pure, without any mixed factors. They are a rare species in the current environment. On the other hand, the opposite is true for Dongda. We hope for a pure society, but the films and TV shows we produce come with too many burdens. That's why we love foreign movies more. What's not seen in overseas society is clean, but he is willing to let people believe that it's true. We promote vigorously every day here, and the more we promote, the less people will watch.

Please give ordinary workers the rights they deserve, which are not money and power, but the right to life they enjoy. Everyone in any position is unique and can create their own life. Accept diversity and embrace diversity. Not every case is meant to save the world. If the day comes to save the world, this society and country are enough for people to love and believe in her, we will have thousands of Nick and Judy.",2,1,0.1667512926887927,0.9992,4
rw11013612,southdavid,6.0,2025-12-09,Snake Pliskin.,"I normally would start this review with my thoughts about the original, but if I'm honest I can't remember what I thought about it, and I've not felt driven to rewatch it since the first viewing at the cinema. With the initial reviews I saw being universally negative, I was pleasantly surprised with how much I did enjoy it.

Just a week after becoming partners, and still bathing in their success saving the city, Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) and Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman) are naturally over-confident in their abilities. When they bungle a bust on a smuggling ring, and clash over their varying enthusiasm levels, they begin to question just how suitable a partnership they really are. They investigate the potential return to the city of a snake, a species long since removed from the biosphere and come to learn a dark truth about the origins of Zootropolis.

There perhaps should be no surprise that, despite the relatively quick turnarounds of this and ""Moana 2"" the film looks excellent. There's so much small detail built into each shot, throwaway gags and moments it's very impressive. There's also a rich vein of homage and parody, the cutdown ""Silence of the Lambs"" moments is well discussed, but there's an excellent ""The Shining"" homage too. The performances from the cast are good, even if perhaps nobody strays to far away from the sort of characters they most commonly play, it's a deep bench too, with Michelle Gomez, Mae Martin and Cecila Strong being amongst the calibre of acters to just play one scene cameos.

I thought the story was reasonable, though some of the twists I felt I did see coming. That said I'm not exactly the films target audience.

Most kids leaving the theater say they liked the first one better. Zoo2 has a chaotic plot structure, overloaded backgrounds and scenarios, and locales for the plot. OK: I get it - it works as a parody of a Mission Impossible Film. A lot of the film could just have been pruned, with more time spent enjoying some of the great visual scenes, and characters.

rw10986552,ChetXBuck,,2025-11-29,"Great Family Entertainment - Fun, Fast, Sophomoric","Zootopia II is a well-written, energetic, and often delightful family film-absolutely worth seeing in a theater, where its color, sound, and pacing feel far more immersive than they would on a distracted night at home. When watched with focus, it delivers a mix of clever writing for adults and broad humor for kids, making it a genuinely enjoyable family outing.

But it is not the equal of the original.

The first Zootopia succeeded because it was unique, warm, and careful. Characters were introduced thoughtfully. The emotional beats were earned. The audience grew to love the world and its residents gradually, with intention.

Zootopia II, by contrast, tries to build a complex and sprawling backstory that becomes more confusing than compelling. It introduces new characters at a rapid-fire pace-sometimes so quickly that it feels as though the filmmakers were determined to cram in as many celebrity voices and toy-ready characters as possible. The result is a sequel that occasionally feels like the more chaotic sophomore films of the 1980s-think Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom or Home Alone 2-fun and energetic, but unfocused and not nearly as strong as the original.

Where the Film Works

When the movie slows down-even briefly-the smart writing shines.

There are clever Easter eggs throughout (the ""Zoogle"" search engine gag, among many others), and these understated jokes and references reward adults without overshadowing the story. At its best, the film uses intelligent plot devices-like recording tech-to ground the action in relatable stakes and emotional reality.

During these quieter, character-focused moments, Zootopia II remembers what made the first film special.

Where It Falters

When it tries to appeal to the youngest kids with nonstop gags, impossible physics, and cartoonish chaos, the film loses its way. The tone occasionally drifts into the worst of 1980s Looney Tunes energy-over-the-top antics that break the film's internal logic and undermine the emotional weight of the story.

The longevity of great animated films comes from relatability-moments of humanity, even in a fantastical world. Zootopia II simply has too many gags and not enough grounding. The overstuffed roster of characters makes it difficult to track relationships or care about new additions.

Final Thoughts

There is a very good movie inside Zootopia II-one that surfaces clearly whenever the filmmakers slow down and let the story breathe. It's smart, often funny, visually rich, and full of potential. But the frenetic pace, character overload, and sequel-itis keep it from achieving the elegance and heart of the original.

I genuinely hope that if a Zootopia III is made, the creators take a cue from the strongest sequels in film history: slow down, focus on character, deepen the humor, and trust the audience enough not to drown them in noise.

Still, for families?

In this movie, Judy is too reckless, reckless to the point where she doesn't seem like a normal person. She lacks the sense of bravery and strategy that a competent police officer exhibits in the first movie, and she doesn't consider Nick's feelings nor their safety at all. It feels like Judy just wants to prove herself and is no different from the villain - she does whatever she wants and doesn't care about Nick at all. She just charges ahead like she has no brain, while Nick turns into some lovestruck fool whose only purpose is to help her.

Throughout this movie, Nick has endured immense injustice. He rescued Judy twice, yet she never expressed gratitude. It truly portrays Judy as a rather immature child.

Many issues clearly had better solutions available, but instead, misunderstandings were created. It felt like the plot was being forced to follow a certain curve, and some scenes that shouldn't have dragged on did so.

rw10981721,Javier1009,8.0,2025-11-27,An excellent expansion to a fantastic universe.,"A colorful, creative universe; a city bursting with life and mystery; charismatic, well-developed characters. These are the main strengths of Jared Bush and Byron Howard's creation. With a fantastic cast, highly imaginative art direction, and sound design crafted with real care and attention, Zootopia stands out as one of the most acclaimed animated projects of recent years, earning over 1 billion dollars at the international box office and winning the 2017 Oscar for Best Animated Feature, along with several other notable awards such as the Golden Globe, Critics Choice Awards, Annie Awards, and more. Because of that, Zootopia 2, its sequel, has always had a pretty high bar to clear if it hoped to match or even surpass the level of its predecessor. Still, the second film in the franchise secures its success by holding onto the aspects that made the first one so iconic, while adding its own creative decisions to the universe and to the characters (both returning and new) in a satisfying way.

Shortly after the events of the first film, Nick and Judy set off on a new adventure to uncover a mystery tied to an old chapter in Zootopia's history. What follows is a series of sequences filled with action, comedy, and charm, without forgetting to make space for character development, reflection, and relationships. New characters are introduced organically into the story and add a lot to how the plot unfolds. The dynamic between Nick and Judy is explored in a deeper and more realistic way, and it's genuinely a treat to watch them connect and understand each other better by the end. The film's theme (or ""moral lesson,"" so to speak) remains quite similar to the first, but there are enough new nuances to justify that. Despite the many strong points, the movie still suffers from rushing through the final act, keeping some important scenes from landing with the weight they deserve; it also shares Disney's recent struggle in creating memorable, well-developed villains with coherent motivations (even in the first movie, the villain was arguably one of the most forgettable characters). Even so, a few standout moments make you want to set those issues aside.

In conclusion, Zootopia 2 is a well-crafted and truly necessary sequel to the first film, expanding its worldbuilding and offering deeper development to its characters. It's an immensely pleasant movie to watch-light without being bland-and it delivers at the very least good entertainment and, at its best, a genuinely unforgettable experience.",2,1,0.25918588873812753,0.9872,2

rw10995750,Abdulxoxo,8.0,2025-12-02,Almost new but not quite,"Watching this sequel, I honestly felt like I'd just slipped back into the same world without missing a beat. The continuity was smooth, almost comforting, and I liked how the story carried the themes from the first film without trying to reinvent anything. There was a soft touch of mystery woven into the plot and a surprising bit of grounded realism, even with all the colourful chaos happening around the characters.

I still really enjoy watching Judy and Wilde together. Their chemistry feels natural and warm, and part of me keeps wondering if the two of them will ever just push things to the next level instead of endlessly skirting around it. At the same time, maybe the teasing works because it keeps their dynamic playful. Either way, their relationship remains one of the strongest parts for me.

What impressed me most was how the film simply built on what was already there. It didn't force new ideas just for the sake of novelty; it stayed smart enough to expand the foundation instead of replacing it. But that also led to one of my issues. At certain points it felt almost too similar to what I'd seen before, like the same story framework with fresh decorations. The familiar cartoon chases and kid-friendly zaniness also wore me out a bit. I kept wishing for more of that slightly darker undertone the original balanced so well.

Once the plot settled, I found it pretty predictable, and the ending wrapped up way too neatly for my taste. Once the truth came out and the villains were exposed, the community shifted its attitude toward the reptiles almost instantly. I couldn't shake the feeling that something that deeply rooted would take real time to heal. Watching everyone suddenly embrace unity made the resolution feel rushed, especially after all the build up about fear and prejudice.

Still, I can't deny I had fun. I think I still prefer the first one, maybe because I've rewatched it so many times that it's burned into my memory. Maybe this one just needs another viewing to grow on me. Either way, it's a good film and a genuinely solid sequel that respects what came before it.",0,1,0.2112682951968666,0.9911,2

After an entire year of not so great movies, we finally have a movie that is genuinely good/great. Byron Howard and Jared Bush did a fantastic job with this movie. For a movie that was in development since 2017, which is one year after the original film came out, it really does shows that they had enough time in the oven to craft something amazing. Much like Inside Out 2, Zootopia 2 isn't afraid to expand the story and the universe while also introducing great new characters. Key Huy Quan as Gary De'Snake was by far the best of the newcomers.

You can tell the cast and crew had fun with this movie. The humor is honestly ever funnier than the first. At one point, Nick brings up childhood trauma and Chief Bogo respond with ""do you want adult trauma?"" But probably the most funniest moment in the movie is when Judy and Nick were looking for the viper and when she thinks Nick found the viper, it's revealed that he found ""a vindow viper"" me and the rest of my theater laughed a lot during this movie. No matter how dark the movie was, it still had heartfelt moments to go along with it as well as moments that made me gasp or even cry. Nick & Judy fighting over the Carrot Pen as they are climbing to the Honeymoon Lodge was a cute scene at first but then once the Carrot Pen shattered to pieces, it broke my heart and the fact that Judy didn't continue to argue with Nick but just kept moving without saying a word was perfect. I was expecting her to continue the argument with Nick but Disney handled that scene the right way. The ending of this movie was genuinely heartfelt especially when Nick Wilde repaired the Carrot Pen and Judy Hopps recorded him saying ""love you partner"". It doesn't mean they are a romantic couple, it just means that they are best partners and friends at the moment. Which is good. The only one problem that I have with this film is the villain. I saw it coming from a mile away that Pawbert was going to be the main villain of the movie. But, he is at least a better twist villain than Bellwether, I'll give him that. Judy Hopps has always been my favorite character in these movies but Gary De'Snake is a close second for me. Key Huy Quan brought so much heart to this movie and his role. It's also nice to see Patrick Warburton in this. The new mayor that he plays in this movie is funny and badass. When he kicks the tails of the Lynxleys, it was super satisfying to watch. The character dynamics between Judy & Nick are well fleshed out and it's interesting to see their partnership unfold on screen. And finally, the movie is not as politically heavy as the first film which is a welcome addition because I come for a good fun movie than a lecture. Listen, you should go see this movie.

rw10986932,mieriks,7.0,2025-11-29,Alright,"This movie, about brave rabbit cop Judy Hopps and her friend who team up again to crack a new case, is a good sequel to Zootopia (2016)!

Overall, I think it's a bit of a disappointment compared to my expectations. The reviews were great, so I assumed it would be as good as - or better than - its predecessor, but I was mostly wrong. The plot is fine, but it feels like a very standard mid-sequel. The movie leans too much on coincidences, the stakes never feel high, and the characters aren't that memorable. It all gets a bit straightforward. And is it just me, or does some of the animation actually look worse than Zootopia's? Much of it is gorgeous, but a few scenes and environments look surprisingly flat.

That said, while I don't think it fully earns its place as a sequel, it does work as a standalone movie. The real strength is the protagonists, Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde - I adore them. Their partnership is still great, and their relationship deepens in a way that almost hints at romance... maybe in a future ""Zootopia 3?"" The movie is also packed with references (especially Disney ones), and the humor is constant. A couple moments even caught me off guard - especially the walrus who stares straight into your soul and greets his friends in the weirdest way. Loved that.

rw10981036,Overflowingwithideas,7.0,2025-11-26,Zootopia is back to the top of the food chain,"Let's rip this band-aid off right now. Zootopia 2 is not a masterpiece. It doesn't surpass the original, nor is it even as good. It is a definitive step down. That said, it is still an immensely enjoyable experience, and leagues better than the other recent output by Disney.

We might as well start with the paw-sitives. Michael Giaccino has returned to compose the soundtrack for this film, and as always, brings his A-game. Giaccino perfectly encapsulated the feel of this world, and created a sound I honestly would listen to on its own.

The visuals are another incredible step up from the original. The first one looked amazing, but the new engine Disney used to render this picture makes the colors pop even more. The motion is fluid and mesmerizing, and each character has their personality shine through their animations. From Judy's floppy ears, to Gary's tail twisting to form a thumb, each character is fully realized by the incredibly talented team.

The humor, for me at least, is easily on par with the first one. From the complex environmental humor to the simple name replacement of popular brands. Almost all of the jokes land for all audiences. They even threw in an unexpected threesome joke halfway through the film. The group I went with was very divided on that one. Some felt it went too far and was inappropriate for kids, but for me, it was a welcome return to the way family films used to be. Kids wouldn't understand that joke, and it provides a reason to rewatch it as an adult, unlike most family films, which are fully uninteresting to adults.

MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD

The story is one of my few major criticisms of this film. Disney has once again fallen into the trap of, what I have dubbed the ""Incredibles 2 Syndrome."" That being retreading the same plotline from the first. Judy and Nick once again have to learn how to work together, a group of animals is once again being oppressed by someone in order to retail power, and once again, Judy must prove herself to the ZPD and herself that she is a capable cop. These redundancies made me groan multiple times in annoyance.

As upset as I am about this retread, it's not all doom and gloom. We once again have another twist villain, but this one is actually handled significantly better. Bellwether was revealed far too close to the end, with next to no foreshadowing. This new antagonist has a real motivation beyond simple power, and is foreshadowed well enough for a family film. To make it even better, this antagonist isn't the only one. We also have truly hateable villains who are revealed to be villains almost immediately.

While I could point out my other issues with this film, in truth, they aren't huge deals. And who really wants to read the nitpicky ramblings of a random cinephile? There are a few small plotholes, dumb decisions, and truly asinine writing decisions that take up a sizable chunk of the film, but ultimately don't drag the score down too much. If you're looking for a fun film to watch with your family, this will definitely satisfy that need. Here's hoping Disney learns from what this film does right, as well as what it does wrong, and we get more well crafted family films in the future. I simply cannot wait for Zootopia 3.

rw10994164,petraktheman,8.0,2025-12-02,An Actually Good Disney Sequel!,"A good Disney Sequel! Zootopia 2 is a pleasant surprise with how seamlessly it connects to the first film, feeling like a natural continuation of the story that expands the characters and world without sacrificing the character arcs of the previous film. It's so much fun getting to see reptiles and marine mammals incorporated into the world of Zootopia. The action is exciting, the new settings are very creative, and the comedy is still hilariously fast-paced and dense. There are so many fast visual and verbal gags blank it or you miss it, including several hilarious references to other Disney movies, Succession, Silence of the Lambs, and even The Shining. We also get an insane Dik Dik joke. I like Nick and Judy's growing dynamic and conflict of reckless pursuit of justice vs snarky cynicism. Like the original, the film has a great voice cast with tons of cameos (my favorites being Danny Trejo aa the basilisk and Patrick Warburton as the Schwarzenegger-inspired horse Mayor). The beaver conspiracy theorist was funny, and I liked the Walrus humor in Marsh Town. Gary De'Snake was such a sweetheart! He's very likable and voiced so well by Ke Huy Quan and animated so well. He's so likable and innocent and curious and funny with his fast paced curious animation and innocent sounding kind hearted voice acting. That being said, I wish reptiles and especially Gary were in it longer (also more reptile species like blue tongue skins, Gila monsters, or literally any crocodilians). I also wish there was a longer time skip and more incidents show to justify the tension and threat of termination of Nick and Judy's police partnership (plus they're arguably TOO similar as they're both impulsive wild cards and the dynamic feels a bit one sided this time with Judy's recklessness being less challenged than Nick's indifference). Complaints aside, it's still a very solid and well-made movie. The main theme with the villains was on-point and there's even a good twist villain and storyline about corporate lobbying and redlining. We even get a nice little Easter egg tease after the end credits. It's a very passionate and creative movie and easily the best non-Pixar Disney sequel ever made (a low bar, but still very impressive!).",0,0,0.25105113636363635,0.9928,4

As a film i can't say it's bad , it's not that good and it is nothing special but there were some great stuff to it i have to admit that but in the recent years i have been avoiding major disney and pixar releases because simply they have been controversial and they leaned towards the ""stuff"" if yk , But thank god this film had nothing of those sorts.

The film was fun and had some great moments but i can't help but just don't feel connected with the main story like yeah they did their part of showing us the backstory of the snakes that ruled and created zootopia once but in my prespective that's just a a lazy template to work on to expand the Zootopia world and i didn't really love the story all that much it felt undriven and sometimes unclear.

The good thing is the visuals and the animation obivously and the whole new world of this zootopia universe that they are in , i liked the voice acting aswell gotta say i really liked the mayor character that was voiced by Patrick Warburton also i really liked the casting of Danny Trejo he is awesome and the other cast did a great job aswell.

Overall i didnt expect much and to be honest the film wasn't WOW or anything i just watched it because of the The Shining reference and if it wasn't for that i wouldn've watched it in the first place , but atleast it was kind of enjoyable to say the least it has some cool moments and honestly some jokes landed too and overall Okay film had a little fun but not too much. 7.1/10.",0,1,0.2887342815914244,0.9961,0

rw11010504,gavinp9,7.0,2025-12-08,"Solid sequel, still fun enough","'Zootopia 2' is another strong whodunnit with our likeable odd-couple pairing of Judy Hopps (Goodwin, the rabbit) and Nick Wilde (Bateman, the fox) as the anthropomorphic new police recruits. Huge returning cast - police chief/buffalo Bogo (Elba), popstar gazelle (Shakira), mole Mr Big (LaMarche) and sheep Bellweather (Slate). Plus new additions Nibbles the beaver (Feimster), Gary the snake (Huy Quan), mayor/horse Winddancer (Warburton) and the lynx's - Pawbert (Samberg) and his father Milton (Strathairn).

The case starts with the unveiling of a 100-year-old journal that is part of a cover-up to how the city of Zootopia was established - and the mystery of why there's no reptiles there. This is where conspiracy theorist Nibbles comes in to help Judy & Nick, as they're framed for helping Gary. The story is pretty obvious, and lots of parallels to immigrants helping establish the USA. There's so many locations and other animals, it's sometimes hard to keep up with all the jokes and references - Ratatouille, The Shining, Google, Babe, Cinderella, Starsky & Hutch - the list goes on.

Some of the biggest laughs are in the marsh, with the walruses and sea lions (don't call them seals!). There's probably some scary bits for young kids and it may be a bit long at 105min, but has a satisfactory ending and another end credits song by Shakira. Not quite as great as the original, but still a fun kids-film-that-adults-can-enjoy, carried by the strong performances from the 2 leads and their giant support cast.",0,0,0.15693392255892252,0.9729,4

rw11014436,pedroquintaoo,7.0,2025-12-09,A Sequel That Plays Safe,"I loved the first Zootopia. I've always considered it one of the few truly original Disney animations of the last 15 years that managed to be genuinely creative and memorable. I adored how it blended humor, social commentary, and a vibrant animal world full of personality. So, of course, I went into Zootopia 2 with very high expectations.

The truth is, the sequel keeps much of the charm of the original, but it never quite reaches that sense of surprise. It's like going back to a restaurant you love: the dish is still delicious, but it no longer has that thrill of the first bite. The duo Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde remains fantastic. They carry the story with the same chemistry and energy that made the first film so special. They're layered characters, full of personality, with amazing energy.

There's also a new character-a snake-who, in the promotional materials, seemed set to turn the duo into a dynamic trio. But it lacks that instant charisma you feel when a character is destined to leave a mark on a saga.

What does return, though, is what always made Zootopia shine: humor based on animal behavior, which works brilliantly again. On that front, the references to Ratatouille and The Shining were a lovely touch and genuinely made me laugh.

However, the main issue with Zootopia 2 is the lack of a surprise factor. The second act drags. It's not boring, but it didn't excite me either. Still, it's one of those films that, even without reaching the heights of the original, remains excellent family entertainment. It has rhythm, humor, beloved characters, and a creative universe that can easily entertain both kids and adults.",0,0,0.34411859193438143,0.9985,2
rw10992780,tegarturaya-51482,8.0,2025-12-01,"Fun to watch, less value to offer","It's a fun to watch. But i wanna highlight the value core of the movie that I got.

First Zootopia clearly set the theme to self discovery and achieving dream, it delivers well on how Judy trying to prove herself worth for solving the case and being a good ZPD rather than just being a parking duty officer. Also we can feel her achievement might be meaningless when it once feel meaningful and how she could handle it. It delivers well, we got the message, I even learn that my dream worth to pursue and I wont give up till I reach the end.

While this sequel trying to highlight the dynamics friendship of Judy and Nick, and that's the problem is. Judy and Nick relationship has been settle in a very good way on the first movie. They solve the cases together, they know each other, we can see how much Nick just being nonchalant boy and Judy being the extravagant one. They seems fine and okay with it. It just this movie trying to hard to show Nick and Judy relationship arent truly healthy and quite toxic. And for me it doesn't make any sense because they were comfort with each other behavior.

Also the first movie highlight racism theme and this movie still is about racism, especially about people with capital and labour. It's also highlight agrarian conflict / forced displacement. I like the way they deliver main theme in both movies. But for some reason first main theme feel more influencing than sequel one. Maybe because agrarian conflict/ forced displacement shouldn't be a main theme of a children movie?

So I think this movie is definitely worth the wait though it's not as strong as the previous one and I could expect more Zootopia movie or series in the future.",2,1,0.1984408602150538,0.9786,0
rw10994140,cdjh-81125,8.0,2025-12-02,One of Disney's Best Animated Sequels,"I will admit to having a little bit of a soft spot for Disney animated sequels. For as much as they have the appearance of being little more than cash grabs I still think they frequently expand the worlds and characters in fun and interesting ways, even if they're usually not as good. Zootopia 2 manages to have all of those qualities while I think actually managing to be an improvement on its predecessor.

It's just so unbelievably entertaining from start to finish and it actually manages to feel like some pretty meaningful messages woven in. Just like the first film it's the dynamic at the centre of it where most of the commentary comes from and I really appreciated the fact that the differing world views these characters have isn't just played for comedy but actually feels like it's explored in a meaningful way. It's another solid mystery, with a reveal I will totally admit I did not see coming, and they've succeed at making a world I wish existed for real. There's points in the movie where it really feels like there's a joke a minute and it never felt cheap or like it was trying too hard. I laughed out loud repeatedly and I actually thought it was quite clever in how it's executed. Ke Huy Quan is someone who is proving himself to make any new part he's in be the most wholesome aspect of the movie and that's no different here. Both his character and the movie as whole will end with you wanting to be a better person and I love it when a film gives me that feeling.

I think the Zootopia movies manage to be unbelievably entertaining whilst having a meaningful message that's woven in so seamlessly and those are the kinds of family movies that I think have the endure the longest. The first movie isn't even one of my favourites from Disney but I think the sequel actually makes me appreciate it more. Just like Inside Out 2 last year if they keep taking their time to tell meaningful new stories I truly believe that this franchise could go on forever.",0,0,0.21050505050505056,0.9977,0

It expands on the Zootopia world with introducing new biomes and adding reptiles into the world. Nick and Judy's relationship is about the same from the last movie. Nick is probably the weakest of the two in character development but they still have good chemistry. The story is great with some good social commentary about gentrification and appropriation.

A solid animal police procedural sequel. The story explores how the differences in personality, nature, and communication can affect a relationship. The movie does expand on the city of Zootopia and its history, giving it depth and substance. There is action, suspense, comedy, and some throwback references that older people may understand.

rw10985890,trazanovnikolay,9.0,2025-11-28,What an amazing sequel!,"These 9 years of waiting were actually worth it! New interesting characters with reasonable motivations, awesome visuals of different parts of Zootopia and some humour as a cherry on top of the story.

We get what we've loved in the first part - action scenes, mystery, some characters that are not to be trusted. But here Disney goes deeper in Zootopia City and uncovers the racial bias of it really well. The reptiles being discriminated and pushed out of their homeland, prejudices and biases against them and the impact of governmental systems and celebrities on civilisation's minds - we see lots of parallels to our reality, making the story realistic and interesting to watch. The visuals of each location in the film (deserts, mountains or snowy areas) makes your eyes actually relax and enjoy the story on a higher level.

Yet, there were some parts where the plot seemed to be rushed. It didn't significantly ruined the rhythm of the story, but it's just some actions were at some point illogical.

Anyway, I really like Disney's message about racial justice and friendly behavior towards different groups of people (or ""animals"" if being more precise). This is what should be told to children in every cartoon to make our humanity achieve racial equality and harmony. All in all, I really recommend this movie to any age group: children could enjoy crazy plot twists, and adults could learn something new from it.",2,1,0.279399766899767,0.9923,4
rw10992969,CinePath,6.0,2025-12-01,Zootopia 2,"Zootropolis 2 is a continuation of the 2016 film. The sequel has its strengths as well as weaknesses. On the positive side, the creators handled the story well - it's interesting to watch the rabbit and the fox working together again. The music is good and fits the atmosphere nicely.

The story itself is rather average, which wouldn't be a problem if the film relied more on action. Here, however, the action feels weaker. Some of the jokes meant to lighten the mood don't really work.

The first film felt more mature - older viewers could relate to Judy, who was trying to succeed despite everyone doubting her. The second film has a more child-like story. It's about the fox and the rabbit learning to accept each other's mistakes and becoming better at cooperating. But the snake in the story feels almost too innocent, too ""sugar-sweet."" The plot twist near the end is predictable, which is a shame, because older viewers will immediately know how it's going to end.

Overall, the film will be enjoyed mainly by families with children.",2,3,0.25409090909090915,0.944,2
rw11001302,sunyx-26086,9.0,2025-12-05,ootopia 2: Growing Pains in a Perfect City?,"Nine years after the original Zootopia redefined what a ""talking animal cartoon"" could be, Zootopia 2 returns to the mammal metropolis with a sequel that feels less like a reboot of the formula and more like an extended second chapter. The story once again follows Officer Judy Hopps and her partner Nick Wilde, now firmly established as a crime-fighting duo inside the ZPD. The plot framework is familiar: a new case erupts that threatens the delicate harmony of the city, pulling Judy and Nick through multiple districts, forcing them to question their assumptions, and ultimately confronting a deeper social fault line under Zootopia's seemingly inclusive surface.

The case itself is designed less as a whodunit twist machine and more as a pressure cooker. A series of incidents-suspicious crimes, growing tensions between different groups, and a wave of public anxiety-start to erode the uneasy peace established at the end of the first film. Judy, still driven by her idealism and sense of duty, pushes to treat this as a solvable problem: find the culprits, expose the scheme, restore harmony. Nick, with his older, warier streetwise instincts, senses that what they're facing isn't just a single villain but a mood, a climate, the way fear spreads through a city. As their investigation deepens, the pair confront not only suspects and red herrings, but also institutional hesitation, media distortion, and their own evolving roles as ""faces of the new Zootopia.""

Plotwise, Zootopia 2 is less about reconstructing some elaborate mystery and more about watching how the city responds to stress. We see old locations and new corners of Zootopia, familiar faces and fresh side characters whose lives are disrupted by the case. The film moves from comedic set-pieces-botched undercover operations, culture-clash misunderstandings, physical gags that riff on different species' sizes and abilities-to heavier sequences where crowds turn hostile, friendships fray, or long-ignored resentments bubble up. The resolution is satisfying more in its emotional logic than in pure plot surprise: the ""who"" and ""how"" are important, but the real payoff lies in what this crisis reveals about Judy, Nick, and the city they've dedicated themselves to serve.

Judy Hopps remains the moral engine of the series, but she is no longer the wide-eyed rookie hopping off the train for the first time. In this sequel, her optimism has edges. She knows how ugly things can get, she knows how much one mistake or one careless speech can hurt others, and yet she still insists on believing that institutions can be better and people can change. The film tests that belief by putting her in situations where following the rules feels inadequate or even complicit. Her character trait of stubbornness, once purely charming, now cuts both ways: sometimes it's heroism, sometimes it's a blind spot that puts others at risk. Watching her navigate that line gives the film much of its emotional texture.

Nick Wilde's arc is subtler but just as important. In the first film, his journey was about learning to trust again and stepping into the badge. Here, the tension is what it means for a once cynical outsider to become part of the system. Nick's trademark sarcasm is intact, but the jokes occasionally hide a deeper unease: he knows how quickly public opinion can turn on predators, on foxes, on anyone who doesn't fit the comforting majority image. His loyalty to Judy is never in question, but the film gently asks whether loyalty to a partner automatically equals loyalty to the entire institution behind that badge. When he hesitates, pushes back, or suggests taking a less official route, it's not just for laughs-it's a reminder of his history and the communities that still see him as ""one of us"" rather than ""one of them.""

The supporting cast remains vibrant. Chief Bogo, Clawhauser, and other returning officers give the film continuity and humor, while new characters-civilians caught in the middle, local leaders, and those tempted to exploit the crisis-serve as mirrors to different parts of Zootopia's social fabric. Even minor characters are designed with clear traits: a timid citizen whose fear is understandable but easily manipulated, a charismatic figure whose rhetoric sounds reasonable until you hear what it implies for those on the margins, a comic-relief side character who unexpectedly reveals a moral spine at a crucial moment. These small beats keep the world feeling lived-in rather than symbolic.

Visually, Zootopia 2 is everything you would expect from a big-budget Disney sequel and then some. The cinematography leans into the contrast between districts: clean, airy compositions in the city center, dense, layered frames in crowded neighborhoods, kinetic ""handheld-feeling"" shots in chase sequences that make the camera feel like it's weaving through fur and traffic. The color palette shifts with mood: warm, saturated hues in comedic or celebratory scenes; colder, harsher light as tensions escalate; even subtle haze and depth-of-field tricks to emphasize when our heroes feel lost in a crowd or singled out under scrutiny. The animation of fur, weather, and mass movement is almost distractingly good, but it's the smaller choices-how the camera lingers on Judy's ears drooping or Nick's tail flicking when he's nervous-that carry character emotion without dialogue.

Thematically, the film extends the first Zootopia's interest in prejudice and coexistence into a more mature space: not ""do prejudices exist?"" but ""what happens after the big apology speech is over?"" It tackles how fear rebrands itself as ""common sense,"" how calls for security can be weaponized, and how even well-meaning people can retreat into their own groups when things get tense. It also quietly explores burnout and responsibility: what does it cost Judy and Nick, emotionally, to be symbols? Are they allowed to be tired, wrong, or scared, or must they always be examples for others? The movie doesn't resolve all of these questions neatly, but it at least raises them in ways both kids and adults can feel.

On the lighter side, the film continues the franchise's tradition of stuffing the frame with Easter eggs. Background billboards, store names, and movie posters parody both real-world pop culture and other Disney properties; there are playful nods for those who know the studio's catalog, and a few blink-and-you'll-miss-them gags involving familiar silhouettes and musical cues. The end-credits sting, a small but affectionate extra scene, doesn't hard-tease a plot for Zootopia 3 so much as leave the door invitingly ajar: the city is still growing, new neighbors are still arriving, and there are clearly more stories to tell if the studio chooses to return.

As a whole, Zootopia 2's strengths are clear. It respects its audience, refuses to reduce complex social dynamics to simple slogans, and gives its central duo real emotional work to do. The world-building remains rich and funny, the pacing rarely drags, and the balance between comedy and heavier material is carefully managed. Its weaknesses are, perhaps inevitably, those of many high-quality sequels: it lacks the shock of the new, some beats feel like variations on themes you already know, and a couple of side characters could have used more room to breathe. Viewers looking for a tight mystery might find the investigation more atmospheric than intricate.

From a neutral perspective, Zootopia 2 doesn't dethrone the original, but it doesn't need to. It operates as a thoughtful, entertaining continuation that deepens the city and its inhabitants rather than trying to outdo every twist and punchline. For fans who have waited years to step back into Zootopia, it offers exactly what a good sequel should: a sense of coming home, with just enough fractures in the façade to remind you that even in a ""perfect"" city, growing up-and growing together-never really ends.",0,0,0.11415389122156036,0.9961,2

I can't believe it's been nearly 10 years since Disney animation released the smash hit ZOOTOPIA, a ""bunny-cop"" movie about a rabbit joining forces with a fox to solve a case in a world full of animals. Now, ZOOTOPIA 2 is finally out of the hat (yes, I'm trying to cram as many animal puns in here as I can). The story takes place just one week after the original. Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) and Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman) are now partners on the police force, the first mixed species team ever. Everybody around them is skeptical of their partnership, but the dynamic duo is determined to prove them wrong. They pick up a new case and are immediately embroiled in a conspiracy involving a snake named Gary De'Snake (Ke Huy Quan) and how Zootopia is able to cohabitate all kinds of land mammals. Along for the ride are new and funny characters such as the beaver podcaster and conspiracy theorist Nibbles Maplestick (Fortune Feimster). This movie is just as amazing as the original, perhaps a smidge funnier. It's full of funny animal puns/jokes, references (some not just for kids), and an extremely heartfelt message of friendship. Another, more adult message in here is about how a group of animals were wiped off the map by another group. I feel like whenever Disney tries to make an animated musical these days, it fails. Yes, there is one song in this, but it's actually catchy and good. I love how there are entirely too many known voices in this, definitely too many to type out here. Despite the familiar buddy-cop story, the core is still Judy and Nick's relationship. It's complex, authentic, and it brings out some emotion. This movie is on par with K-POP DEMON HUNTERS as my favourite animated movie of the year, also probably one of the best Disney sequels out there.

rw10986606,BlizzyFoxTF,4.0,2025-11-29,Zootopia 2016 but a lot tamer & weaker,"I am grossly disappointed. They upted the ante when it comes to the visual gags & animal related jokes which gets unfunny very quickly. The old characters are so shoehorned in & the new characters are way weaker than the two protagonists. The snake is nowhere near as interesting as Judy from the first film, whose journey to make it into the ZPD through will & hard work despite her apparent size is many folds more inspiring & clever than any arcs & themes brought up in Z2.

Same goes for the clever carnivore vs herbivore race allegory from Z1, we get sth similar but 1) it is a rehash but soo sooo much weaker 2) didn't say anything that hasn't been said a thousand times already 3) made the message extra clear through dialogue instead of letting the audience figure out for themselves -

Disney has sold out to the kids audience since the 2010s & it is never more apparent here. This sterility goes further than this. Remember the darker themes in Z1? Mind control, cannibalism, blood (climax). There is barely a scratch in Z2. You would have thought a 2016 product as cleverly crafted as Zootopia would survive that, but no~

Structurally, the opening was so fast paced & I would much prefer Z1 where you begin in Judy's hometown so you can understand her motivation; this makes the payoff later on more impactful. As a result, I am so emotionally disinterested by the third act. The ending felt like impassionate homework.

Z1 was such a great theme & the sequel automatically is granted much potential. I don't think the sequel should take place just a week after the events of Z1, I would have loved to see how the character dynamics organically develop behind the scenes in like say two years time, or the how the zeitgeist changes to better represent modern America (Z1's crowning achievement), and all the new issues that spout from a melting plot of race & cultures, instead of rehashing.

Z2 is sterile & dumbed down version of Z1's timeless concept & social commentary. Bush traded nuance for jokes & safety. Zootopia is a lesser place now than nine years ago.",2,9,0.12141299357208447,0.9892,4
rw10993872,greyKbarclay,8.0,2025-12-01,Amazing sequel!!,"Why on Earth did they make us wait 9 years for this sequel, it was so good.

It did everything a sequel is meant to do; expand upon our understanding of the characters and universe they operate in, give us complex thematic elements that both child and parents will be able to relate to and also manage to give us some new fresh characters, as well as a hilarious use of comedy. Zootopia 2 truly does it all.

Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde have since entered into a turbulent partnership at the ZPD, much to the chagrin of everyone else around them. They shouldn't work as partners but some how they do, but that may have something to do will the fact that they aren't being 100% honest with each other about how well things are actually going.

They're in denial.

They lack of hindsight quickly sees them land in boiling water with Chief Bogo and indeed the rest of the police crew as they wreck havoc all over Zootopia in the name of catching their man. Such the event also gives Judy the scent of a new mystery creating over the horizon, this time in the shape of a snake. Reptiles have not been seen in Zootopia for almost 100 years, akin to the fact that no one trusts a snake. They seem to have no place in the Zootopia that we have already seen.

The snake in question is lovingly voiced by Ke Huy Quan, giving him the most goofy persona imaginable, already changing the audience's, and Judy's, perception of this so called fanged menaces. It's one of the more expanded upon themes from the first film, that the prejudices that people believe have unfortunate consequences, leading into one of the new concepts that this sequel implores to explore; displacement.

Many people have already drawn many a parallel to the events happening in Gaza at this time, and also the continued threatening prescence of ICE detaining people illegally. It is revealed at the end that the nefarious snow leopards of Tundra Town deceived the entirety of Zootopia and used the fear-mongers technique of a supposed venomous fanging to sway public opinion.

The accuracy of all the different cities that make up Zootopia is insane. The ability to animate all those intricacies and still manage to make sure that the important details shine through in order to progress the story. We get to see a lot more of Tundra Town in this instalment, as well as some interesting new environments like Marsh Market and the illicit reptilian bar.

It's a direction that we all knew we were heading in when Nick and Judy were announced as partners at the conclusion of the first film; that their differing perspectives may be the root cause of their downfall. And it was... but only for sometime. They are actually made to attend partner therapy at the beginning of the film and while it proves to be a little bit of a bust because they just aren't really to be honest with each other.

rw11001157,valen060,9.0,2025-12-05,Let Us Paws & Reflect: Disney Tackles Prejudices Again In Zootopia,"Walt Disney Animation Studios has made a handful of sequels to some of their animated films for nearly the last decade. Films like Wreck-It Ralph, Frozen, and Moana all spawned a sequel and released in theaters. But for some reason, they felt unfocused in terms of storytelling and proper character development. However. What I really like about animated sequels is world building. While you can get returning characters being thrusted into a new adventure and also introducing new characters along the way, story is always important and should not be ignored. Now as for Zootopia 2? It remains focused on that. I mean, it still has the same material as the 2016 original in terms of prejudicial themes and discrimination, but what I believe adds to it here is immigration.

About a week after bunny cop Judy Hopps and streetsmart con artist fox Nick Wilde cracked their first case together. Nick is now an official police officer and working alongside Judy in their next assignment. In this case tracking down a wanted fugitive identified as Gary De'Snake. With the first reptile showing himself in the presence of Zootopia inhabitants, there's more to his presence than initially believed. Gary knows he's trying to do the right thing, but he'll need the generous assistance of Nick and Judy to set things right, even if it means the duo is risking their own careers as law enforcers.

Stars Jason Bateman and Ginnifer Goodwin reprise the roles of Nick and Judy respectively, including a few other returning characters voiced by Idris Elba, Alan Tudyk, Nate Torrance, and Jenny Slate. But new to the cast like Ke Huy Quan (The Goonies, Everything Everywhere All At Once) is proving to be a worthy addition in this all animal cast. The entire movie is also stacked with an all-star cast of actors either for voice cameo or minor role. I can go on forever about the Disney Easter eggs and other cameos. Fortunately, these don't distract from the story at all. I like the message that it was trying to display. It's like don't judge a book by its cover. On the outside, it's about the witty humor and gags that made the characters likable while on their journey. However, on the inside. It's like we delve deep into the lore and depth within this caper. While the kids will enjoy the lightheartedness and funny moments along with their parents, it will make adults look more into the context of what the story is really trying to convey.

There's a balance of humor and seriousness that had me remain engaged, so I wasn't bored at all. Zootopia 2 is without a doubt a worthy successor helmed by returning director Jared Bush. Awesome job from the cast and crew!",0,0,0.1551032647907648,0.9966,2

I really don't know if they realised it when making it, but this movie at its core has a very political message. It feels like the current political environment affected the creators, I'd be surprised if it didn't. ""Zootopia 2"" touches on more mature themes and it showcases them respectfully. It's a much more mature tale than the first movie. Judy and Nick are the perfect duo, their chemistry is everything. This is a really good story with a great plot and some great exploration of partner dynamics. A very mature work. This feels like Disney done right! They used to serve as a platform to showcase important themes, but they've recently turned into cash grabbing oligarchs.

rw10985516,EkZack,4.0,2025-11-28,Poor Nick is a Secondary Character,"The graphics, animation, and visuals are all nice and interesting, and you do look forward to seeing how they build this turtle neighborhood, reptiles neighborhood, etc. But I'm not sure I'd say it's the best storyline ever. The first 15-20 minutes are about the couple again and their struggle to be believed, their differences, etc. (we already had that and solved it in ""season 1"").

It almost felt like Nick was a secondary character to Judy. She's the one fighting, getting the calls from her parents, etc. Most of what we see of him is just his perspective on what's happening, without really connecting it back to his character development, personal backstory, or anything deeper.

Then there's this whole snake/lynx drama that was fine but very predictable and kind of... generative? Like, it feels like you could reuse the same template: just bring another villain and another victim, write a similar plot, and boom, you have ""season 3."" The dialogue and jokes also felt flat and sometimes forced.

Maybe I'm being harsh because it's a Disney production? But I remember I actually dozed off while watching. It had no real edge or feeling of urgency. You don't feel like this plot is super close to the main characters or really affecting them. Like, if they got caught, what's the worst that would happen for most of the movie? They'd get fired. (Yes, their lives were endangered toward the end, but still.) Going this far to save a stranger snake from a stranger villain didn't feel like the strongest plot.

If it were me, I might've written a villain who's related to Nick, or even his own brother, and have Nick and Judy go through real moral dilemmas where they, and we, actually learn something or change as people by the end. Right now the ""development"" we get is that Nick says he loves her and cares about her, like, no sh? I'm not saying every character has to have massive growth every time, but there's a lot of space and creativity here to do something bigger, and they just went with a generic, overused plot.

rw10996042,DUDE-I-DO-REVIEWS,8.0,2025-12-02,A worthy sequel,"ZOOTOPIA 2 stays right on track with its predecessor. I still can't help but wonder why it took almost ten years to finally get this sequel.

Let's start with the animation: it looks awesome. This world is just so much fun to spend time in. There are some really nice, unique set pieces, and I still love the cleverness of having big and small animals living in the same space. We explore a couple new areas, though I wish we had explored more. I did really dig the marsh and all of the animals and hijinks that came with it.

The story picks up right after the first movie. Judy and Nick are now officially partners in the police department, and that's where this movie truly shines. Their dynamic is on point. This is a full-on buddy-cop comedy, and I'm a sucker for those - and it works incredibly well here. Sure, it's an animated family movie, but I could totally picture this story playing out in live action. We also get a solid lineup of new characters that fit perfectly into the world, but Judy and Nick are still the standouts. Their relationship is genuinely beautiful and remains the heart of the film.

The voice cast, both returning and new, once again delivers across the board, but what really brings this movie to life is the humor. I found this to be absolutely hilarious - tons of great jokes, gags, and laughs throughout.

Overall, ZOOTOPIA 2 is a worthy sequel that sits right alongside the original, hitting all the right beats. The whole family had a blast with it, and I definitely recommend checking it out.

rw10990794,sengelbrecht-36920,8.0,2025-11-30,Finally a great Disney Sequel,"Thanksgiving is an excellent time full of turkey, family, togetherness, and animal puns. That's right, as has been tradition for many years now, Disney Animation releases a movie right before Thanksgiving to capitalize on children being off school and families getting together for the holidays. This year, we have a sequel to the 2016 animated hit Zootopia, and with the entire cast returning, it'll be a surefire box-office hit. I very much enjoyed the first Zootopia back in 2016. It was an entertaining kids' movie with some great adult/real-world themes that were incorporated very well into the plot. Looking back on it, it isn't the MOST rewatchable animated movie, but it still was a very entertaining film. There was a lot to work with if you wanted to make a sequel. In the end, this stands as one of the better Disney sequels we've gotten from them over the years!

Zootopia 2 takes place merely one week after the first film ended, with Judy Hopps (voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin) and Nick Wilde (voiced by Jason Bateman) as newly appointed partners at the Zootopia Police Department after their first major case with the predators. They are clashing with their coworkers and their Chief Bogo (voiced by Idris Elba), as their personalities/methods are so different that they mess up many things on their cases. Bogo tells them that if they can't work together correctly, he will split them up. Things start to get crazy when Judy discovers a snake skin in a case they do, and even learns that snakes/reptiles haven't been in Zootopia for many, many years.

When Judy and Nick infiltrate the Zootenial Gala, they discover a snake named Gary (voiced by Ke Huy Quan), and they are suddenly framed for working with Gary. And a mystery unravels just like the first movie, with Judy and Nick on the run this time from the Police department and a Lynx family who have some beef with the snakes. It's up to Judy and Nick to solve this mystery, but will they overcome their partner issues to crack the case?

So another typical buddy cop duo/mystery movie just like the previous Zootopia movie, but what sets this apart from the first movie is that element of being on the run, and even some other social hidden meaning that made the first movie so great, this time dealing with who really was the founder of Zootopia and why have reptiles not been seen for decades? You also have a very different dynamic between Nick and Judy as they try to navigate their being partners and how truly opposite they are. The story was outstanding and very heartwarming, with even some twists and turns I didn't expect! The script is very well written, with genuinely funny lines, puns, and scenes.

This is one of the funniest Disney films I've seen in a while, and I enjoyed so many creative ways we got to explore more of this Zootopia world. Not only was the dynamic between these characters very well done, but I also enjoyed how intriguing this narrative was with the snakes and the lynx family. It really made a fun/enjoyable movie while also bringing in many real-world comparisons that anyone would make. Exactly like the first movie, and that's why this film sits on par with the first Zootopia movie (with the side note that this film was way funnier).

The only criticism is that it doesn't quite reach the massive scale of the best Disney movies, where you feel emotional, or the high highs of the best Disney animated films. It's a highly entertaining movie, but I don't expect this to be an annual rewatch or the best animated film of the decade, for sure. It is funny, thought-provoking, fun, adventurous, and, in many ways, a very well-done children's movie. The fact that this movie has grossed $556 million worldwide and that my screening was PACKED shows it will do exceptionally well.

Overall, it deserves to do that well! When you have very mediocre sequels like Frozen 2 and Moana 2, and even a terrible sequel like Ralph Breaks the Internet, it was such a breath of fresh air to have this come out and succeed where those sequels failed. It is an excellent continuation of the first Zootopia, sitting right on par with that film and even featuring better comedy. I really had a great time with Zootopia, and know this is going to be a film that kids and adults will enjoy this Thanksgiving/Holiday season. I give this an 8/10.",1,1,0.258420528335301,0.9994,0
rw11000565,mishahaynie,7.0,2025-12-05,A Fun Ride!,"If you liked the first Zootopia, you're absolutely going to enjoy this one. Zootopia 2 takes things in a surprisingly bold direction - leaning way more into an action-packed, James Bond-style adventure. We're talking elaborate car chases, slick spy-tech sequences, and high-energy fight scenes that crank the intensity way beyond what we saw nine years ago in the original. Not that the movie is bad - far from it - it's just a shock to the system at first because of how different this sequel feels.

Once again, we're blessed with the phenomenal voice talents of Ginnifer Goodwin (Judy Hopps) and Jason Bateman (Nick Wilde), who slip right back into their roles with the same charm, wit, and chemistry that made the first film such a hit. Judy and Nick are back on the beat, forced to prove - once again - that a bunny and a fox can save a city, especially when the odds are stacked against them.

The Supporting Cast & Newcomers

The world expands even further thanks to a loaded supporting cast. Returning favorites like Idris Elba, Jenny Slate, Bonnie Hunt, and Nate Torrence help keep that classic Zootopia flavor intact. But it's the newcomers who really inject fresh energy into the sequel - including Ke Huy Quan as Gary and the sleek new villain De'Snake.

This time, the adventure pushes far outside the familiar boundaries of Zootopia, taking us into previously unseen regions filled with new species, new environments, and a conspiracy that ties everything together. It's honestly one of the coolest expansions of this world that Disney has done in a while.

Is It Better Than the First?

This is where audiences might be split.

Some will say this entry is slightly better because of its bigger scale, sharper action, and deeper mystery. Others may prefer the grounded emotional storytelling and social commentary of the original. Both takes are valid - it really depends on what kind of movie experience you're looking for.

But one thing is universal: Judy and Nick remain one of Disney's strongest, most lovable duos ever. And after this sequel, they absolutely deserve a third film. Their chemistry is just too good to stop here.

Final Thoughts

If you loved the first movie, there's a very strong chance you're going to enjoy this one as well. It's fun, fast, charming, and packed with heart - just delivered in a new, action-spy flavor.

So buckle up, enjoy the ride, and welcome back to the wild world of Zootopia.

They managed to expand the universe of the movie without contradicting what was established in the first movie (unlike *ahem* inside out 2) and the characters are all in character here. The movie does go through a lot of the overused disney cheches, but actually manages to do them all pretty well and convincingly. The movie does still have its infuriating moments though. There are several parts throughout the film where the conflict could be instantly solved if the main characters could have literally just 10 seconds to explain themselves, but we cant have that happen otherwise the movie would be over prematurely, so we gotta drag it out. Id be fine with it if it only happened once, but it was just so annoying how it kept happening.

rw10987455,Elonluan,9.0,2025-11-29,We still yearned for this Zootopia,"In 2025, as globalisation faced unprecedented challenges, we still yearned for this Zootopia.

The 2016 Rio Olympics and the release of Zootopia1 epitomised the 2010s-an era that may well stand as humanity's closest approach to a community with a shared future in our generation's memory. It was precisely this decade that gave birth to Zootopia1, a film brimming with boundless optimism. People yearned to further dismantle societal discrimination and prejudice, even when such divisions fell far short of becoming antagonistic conflicts.

By late 2019, the world rapidly succumbed to the threat of a virus. Persistent regional conflicts and global disorder did not abate with the pandemic's end; instead, the world plunged into an endless post-pandemic era. Nine years after being moved by Zootopia, can we still believe in that beautiful utopia from nine years ago?

Zootopia 2 not only arrives on schedule but delivers a timely response to our era. Where the first film explored tensions between carnivores and herbivores, the sequel confronts the divide between mammals and reptiles. The former stemmed from 'legitimate' and 'mild' discrimination, while the latter points directly towards 'illegitimate' and 'escalated' confrontation. The Zootopia creative team understood they could no longer stitch together a flawless utopia. Instead, they chose to deconstruct Zootopia's societal foundations and rebuild a more refined society.

Though human society comprises a single species biologically, deconstructing and reconstructing it to transform and perfect our world proves infinitely more challenging than shaping the diverse, multi-species ecosystem of Zootopia. Yet in this era of unprecedented upheaval, confronting a society where contradictions intensify daily, humanity has no alternative but deconstruction and reconstruction-even if it entails prolonged growing pains. History has taught us: human progress is never smooth sailing or linear ascent, but a complex spiral of negation upon negation-a unity of forward momentum and tortuous twists. Even though the contradictions within human society can never be attributed to a single evil family, as in the film's plot, Zootopia 2 still chooses to gently present reality to its audience through the lens of a fairy tale. For if we no longer believe in the existence of utopias like Zootopia, the new generation of the 21st century will only be able to recall that world that once came infinitely close to utopia through Zootopia 1.

At least for now, people can still escape the harsh realities of the world and enter this vibrant utopia; looking ahead, humanity will continue to yearn for this hopeful Zootopia, believing that a better world will ultimately arrive.",2,1,0.1417066629023151,0.8501,4

rw10999061,RatedByGautham,8.0,2025-12-04,"""Bigger, Funnier, and Better""","Zootopia 2 is the sequel to the 2016 Oscar-winning animated film, which is one of my all-time favourite animated movies. This new movie fully lives up to the first one. It has no major weak moments, and I can easily say it is one of the best animated films released this year.

The creators have done a great job expanding the world they built in the first part. The concept is again a parallel world where animals live like humans, with their own cities, jobs, and society. In this sequel, the city of Zootopia is shown on a much bigger scale, with beautiful visuals and impressive detailing.

The investigation part is written brilliantly with fun elements, adding both excitement and comedy without breaking the flow of the story. The jokes are smart, funny, and well-timed.

Overall, Zootopia 2 is a well-made & entertaining sequel.",0,0,0.360704816017316,0.992,2
rw11003481,Luke-2181,1.0,2025-12-06,Zootopia 2 and it's laughably bad plot,"To start this off, I enjoyed the movie. There are a lot of things to love about Zootopia 2, but you really must shut your brain off to get there, because the moment you start thinking about how the characters and institutions behave, the story starts falling apart, and nowhere is that clearer than in what the movie does to Nick and Judy.

A toxic relationship is a relationship where one person repeatedly harms the other through manipulation and control by isolating them, creating dependency, and shifting responsibility, so the harmed person feels obligated to stay and ""protect"" them even as the relationship damages their safety, stability, and connections. Typical traits include isolation (pulling you away from others), love-bombing (intense affection used to secure loyalty), manufactured crises that force constant rescuing, guilt and pressure when you try to set boundaries, and externalizing blame (""the real problem is everyone else,"" so you must fight outsiders instead of questioning the relationship). Throughout the story, Judy drags Nick along on increasingly dangerous missions, and her choices repeatedly almost get them both killed, yet the film treats her recklessness like determination and treats Nick's hesitation like weakness, even though Nick is the one thinking about survival, consequences, and the basic reality that ""doing the right thing"" does not protect you from getting buried by the world's systems. Nick tries multiple times to reason with her, urging her to step back, even suggesting taking Mr. Big's deal as an exit, and realistically he probably can't take that path without Judy since Mr. Big only likes her, but the point is that Nick is constantly forced into Judy's spiral and the movie wants us to interpret it as loyalty rather than what it actually looks like: a friend being dragged into danger while being emotionally cornered into accepting it.

Judy's behavior is toxic. The message, taken at face value, is that you should follow your partner into near death, commit crimes, if necessary, destroy your connections with everyone else in your life, and it will all magically work out. Nick is expected to apologize or bend, while Judy never clearly apologizes to him for dragging him into situations that almost get him killed, and if the beaver hadn't been placed within the same cell block as him(which shouldn't have happened as they are opposite genders), he would have been killed by the Lynxley family, which the movie barely acknowledges beyond using it as another beat to push the plot forward, without giving Judy a real moment of accountability or letting the consequences breathe. The closest Judy gets to addressing any of this is when she confesses her feelings about how much Nick means to her, saying ""no one else in the world matters to me more than you(Nick) do either,"" and that line is supposed to show loyalty and care, but in context it paints a disturbing picture because caring about someone should not mean ignoring their fear, dragging them into near-death danger, and risking their life over and over again without any serious reflection afterward.

In The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Judge Frollo is the Minister of Justice of Paris, is tasked with protecting the peace. He uses that position to try to purge the Romani people from the city, and he does it in a way that leads to the burning of Paris. When he meets Phoebus, the war hero, he doesn't assume an automatic agreement. He takes him up to the balcony, shows him his view of Paris, and vents about how he sees the city and how the Romani ""threaten"" it. He doesn't say kill or anything of the like instead he using word like rid. He talks about order, justice, and cleansing, which is exactly how real politicians operate: they avoid the ugly part directly and wrap it in duty and morality. He's also this was a test for Phoebus, watching how he reacts, seeing how far he can pull him along without stating his real endgame outright.

Now look at Cattrick Lynxley in Zootopia 2. He's the head of a powerful, wealthy family. When Gary De Snake kidnaps him and steals a priceless artifact, Judy saves him and Nick knocks Gary out. Cattrick's immediate response is: ""Kill the snake we'll burn the journal, if he wants it, it is dangerous and you two will file a report that he attacked us..."" There's no build-up, no euphemism, no test, just a blunt request, which obviously is denied, for an execution and a falsified report dropped in front of two cops he barely knows, one of whom is famous citywide for taking down two corrupt mayors in the last movie. It's supposed to show how corrupt and ruthless he is, but it ends up just showing this movie's laughably bad writing.

Later, when Nick is caught, Cattrick hints that he has enough influence for bad things to happen to people in prison. That's all the scene needs: the implication that he can make problems ""go away"" without saying it outright. But that only makes the earlier ""Kill the snake..."" moment feel even worse. If he's the kind of person who works through systems, pressure, and connections, then openly demanding Judy allow him to kill Gary on the spot still reads like the movie handing the villain a megaphone instead of letting him be believable. Cattrick could have won if he only let the snake get arrested and then used the connections; he implies he has on the snake.

The twist villain, Pawbert Lynxley, is fine. He functions as a twist as the first movie had one, so they had to also have one. The patent part is shaky. Utility patents like the climate wall end after 20 years. A claim that a single utility patent from 100 years ago still controls everything doesn't make much sense. If the Lynxleys still have control over the wall a century later, the story needs a different explanation: ownership of the infrastructure, contracts, political concessions, control over maintenance, or constantly updated improvements. Even inside the movie's own framing, it raises a weird question. If the Lynxleys were already rich enough to be investors, of a project that would cost over 10s of billions of dollars (as well how would they make any profit from this wall) why would the first Lynxley kill the snake inventor for the patent instead of buying it? Wealthy power structures usually purchase, co-opt, or bury inventions legally when they can. Murdering the inventor feels less like careful legacy-building and more like the writers forcing a ""dark history"" beat because it sounds dramatic.

Then there's the kidnapping from Judy's point of view. Gary De Snake kidnaps Cattrick and steals a priceless artifact. Those are felonies. When Judy corners him, he launches into a sob story, similar to how Nick talked his way through situations in the first film. The difference is that Nick, at that point, wasn't a kidnapper holding a stolen artifact. Gary is a felon, armed because of his fangs, and a direct threat. Judy was tricked once already in the first movie; you'd expect some kind of development. Instead, she starts to fall for the same type of emotional appeal again. On top of that, these scenes land at almost the same point in the runtime as equivalent beats in the first movie, which makes the sequel feel like it's copying the original structure instead of doing anything new with it.

Finally, the reptile ban logic is weak. The movie treats reptiles like a class that ""makes sense"" to exclude, but the justification is basically that 100 years ago a single snake killed a turtle and that led to all reptiles being banned, why not just vipers or have them defanged. Also, if there's genuine demand for safe spaces for reptiles, demand gets met. If the city blocks them legally, then there would be a lot of laws they would have to change but to think such law would still be in place; however, laws are often hidden in what they are meant to do.",1,0,0.04733843763449028,-0.9989,4

To be sure, this installment was, dare I say, a little deeper than the original. The themes of friendship, partnership, and belonging that were covered in the first one were amplified several notches for the sequel.

One thing that worked for me was the James Bond/Mission Impossible nature of this story, which was especially noticeable when Judy and Nick were dressed up for the gala (in the interest of going undercover).

The set pieces were stunningly beautiful, and showed what human beings can do with an idea, hours and hours and hours of animation, music, editing, and more editing to create something that will take your breath away.

Much like the first Zootopia, they really went all out to collect a ""deep bench"" of voice talent, including about a half dozen SNL performers, Disney/Pixar alums, and some fun surprises like Michael J. Fox and Robert Irwin.

All told, I enjoyed this very much and wouldn't mind taking another look to really appreciate the non-AI artistry.

Character Development (B+)

The good news is that the core characters, Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde, remain true to their established selves. The new additions are passable, though online consensus about them being somewhat flat is accurate. The main issue lies with these new faces: one (Gary) has a simplistic but understandable motivation, and the other (Nibbles) is a good-natured character seemingly without any clear motivation at all.

Judy and Nick's depth largely rests on the foundation of the first film; viewed in isolation, the sequel doesn't fully capture their richness. I believe the film suffers from having too many characters. Combining the arcs of the beaver Nibbles Maplestick and the civet Gary might have resulted in a more complete central supporting role. As for the rest of the ensemble, they mainly serve as comedic filler-a style I personally enjoy as it gives a sense of continuity and connection to the broader Zootopia world.

Plot & Pacing (C+)

The plot certainly feels rushed at points. There's a definite sense of over-padding in the setup, with the main resolution crammed into the final twenty minutes. It's hard not to suspect the lengthy buildup contains ideas the writers loved but couldn't bear to cut, or perhaps was simply an excuse for Disney to showcase its dazzling animation capabilities.

The primary storyline is largely sound, except for one segment where the fast development felt solely designed to highlight Judy's individual skill. The real flaws are in the subplots and dropped threads, such as: What was the deal with Mayor Winddancer? Was he truly dealt with? And was the Pig Officer who fired the final shot truly compromised?

Tone & Theme (The Major Flaw) (C-)

This is where the sequel truly falters. The tone is excessively humorous, losing the undercurrent of subdued despair and existential melancholy that permeated the first film. The original's subtle darkness was essential; it was what made Judy's spirit and her optimistic drive to break down stereotypes and combat societal prejudice so valuable. It showcased a small figure fighting against the tide and rebelling against her destiny.

In this film, Judy often feels like she's creating trouble unnecessarily, as many complications could have been avoided. It positions itself as a police story but strips away the essence of police work, portraying its two officer protagonists and the entire ZPD as clueless buffoons largely irrelevant to the plot's core. The sequel devolves into a pure adventure story, losing all thematic depth.

If this script were for a film like The Bad Guys 2, it would be a perfect fit. But for a Zootopia film, I believe it falls short of the mark.

A Final Note on Romance (A+)

While the visuals didn't feel like a noticeable upgrade and occasionally bordered on visual fatigue, the emotional payoff was excellent. Compared to the ""space kiss"" in The Bad Guys 2, the subtle, mutual need and care between Judy and Nick-only explicitly stated at the very end-is far more exhilarating. I absolutely adore this kind of emotional development. Give me more!

The story is very thin and only unravels as the movie progresses. The new characters feel tacked on -- the horse character could have been removed altogether from the movie with no consequences. The number of animal-related puns is just excessive. Every possible word is replaced with a pun. In general I'm a fan of puns, but this is just too much.

This one felt very rushed and fast-paced, so many things were happening all at once, all the time. It still retains its creativity but it was constantly shoving action, Easter eggs, references, and visuals. I feel like I need to watch it two or three more times to really absorb everything.

Judy for me was borderline annoying most of the movie, and for some reason Nick was the butt of EVERYTHING. Animals are dumping water on him, vomiting on him, he's getting hit and running into things, when he and Judy have to eat bugs his is worse, just CONSTANT slapstick directed ONLY at him. Why?? Between Judy being an oblivious, unflinching overachiever and Nick being dumbed down and turned into a punching bag, it felt like their characters took steps backward from not only their development but honesly their baseline in the previous movie. Yes Judy has always been an eager overachiever but she is clever and calculating. Smart bunny. Here she was just constantly throwing herself at the plot, jump first and ask questions later, and antagonizing Nick for being hesitant, even though he followed her faithfully literally everywhere she went. She nearly drowned chasing down Gary, and then got mad when Nick saved her because it ended the chase. And I was as baffled as Nick was. Things did ultimately turn around in the end and they shouted out their feelings for five minutes but guys, I love them and I want better for them!

Most of the new characters were fine, but not very memorable aside from Nibbles and the new mayor. I honestly don't know what Gary's personality was or if he even had one. The mayor was somehow more interesting than the one who was meant to be the pivotal character. The villains were okay. One of them hurts Nick but then the scene changes and everyone forgets about it.

I think the movie's biggest weakness was the writing, at least in terms of the plot. I see some people complaining about the jokes and puns but I think the dialogue was fine. But just about everything involving the plot is explained openly. Judy has a piece and a half of evidence and yet she figures out the entire mystery and explains it out loud to the audience and then they all go to wrap everything up. I guess I can't get past comparing to the first one, but it was just so good and it set a standard for me. I did have fun watching this movie despite all my nitpicks, but there were things that just kept taking me out of it, especially the way Nick was treated.

Things I did like because I feel like I just complained a lot:
-The visuals, world design, character design etc. I do think these movies are super creative with how they portray the animals living in the city. Like it's kind of crazy how well done it all is. I do want to watch this movie again soon because I feel like I couldn't look at everything quickly enough before the scene or camera angle was changing and shoving even more visuals to look at.

-Nick and Judy. I griped enough above but honestly I do love them together, they are the entire reason I was most looking forward to seeing this movie.

-The plot. Not the way it was handled and the expository dialogue, but it was at least a strong extension that easily built off of what had been established for the city in the first movie. It felt very natural, maybe aside from the little recap at the beginning you could watch these movies back to back and it would be an easy transition. Great world-building.

-The mayor. They nailed him.

-The Ze-bros. How could you not like them?

rw10986884,werderliver,7.0,2025-11-29,Decent overall: A collaborative continuation that builds on what Season 1 covered.,"It's hard to believe it's already been 9 years since Zootopia came out. The timing makes the Season 2 release feel a little like a cash grab. The fact that Part 2 picks up just a few weeks after Part 1 also creates a weird disconnect where the characters are frozen in time, but the audience watching is almost a decade older, and even the voice actors have aged in real life.

If the first movie was about the American dream and a young adult stepping into the modern world with innocence and idealism, Season 2 tackles more mature themes while still keeping the light, fun, and accessible vibe. Just like in the original, we get a self-contained mystery that lets the two main characters travel and explore. This time, though, the world feels bigger with more international and clear parodies of various cultures and countries.

The plot structure works if the goal is to focus on the characters' internal and psychological struggles, and that part is genuinely executed well. But considering what the main duo achieved in Season 1, I expected the citizens of Zootopia to treat them with more respect this time.

The film introduces several relevant topics: Masculinity, fatherhood, podcast culture, conspiracy theories, and cultural immersion, but mostly at a beginner level. Not in a shallow way, but more as acknowledgment and reflection rather than deep exploration. The villain is a bit underwhelming, although their motivation is surprisingly refreshing and actually caught me off guard.

The story moves through many places, and while each location is solid and enjoyable, none of them feel truly outstanding or memorable. And that kind of summarizes the whole movie for me: I felt decently satisfied throughout: Never disappointed, but never blown away either. It's basically Zootopia 1 with expanded scope and a few tweaks to the formula.

Overall, it's a good movie. But I'm skeptical of Disney's habit of endlessly recycling old IPs. I'm perfectly happy with Zootopia 1 and Zootopia 2, and I wouldn't be surprised if they make a third. What I don't want to see is a live-action version or a prequel just for the sake of milking the franchise.",0,3,0.17083333333333334,0.9968,2

Yeah it's a kids movie but kids movies always have lessons in them.

Look at how corrupt politicians and those in power are; look at the way they treat the police force like their own personal hit squad doing the dirty work so they don't have to.

Now put on the news and ask yourself, who are we being told to hate, who have we dehumanised to the point where we see them all as the same and none of them as deserving of any decency, compassion or due process, who benefits from that hatred and dehumanisation?

rw10994388,PanchoSanza986,7.0,2025-12-02,"Enjoyable Movie, Complicated Moral","Zootopia 2 is a fun, well-crafted sequel. The animation is gorgeous, the humor lands, and Nick and Judy's chemistry remains the heart of the franchise. As pure entertainment, it delivers.

But I left the theater conflicted about its message.

The film sets up a meaningful arc about heroism. Nick, the cynical fox, appears poised to learn what it truly means to be a police officer-to serve something larger than yourself. Early on, he tells Judy that dying for a case isn't worth it. She looks disappointed. The movie seems to be asking: can Nick grow beyond his self-protective instincts?

His answer, in the climax, is that while he wouldn't die for the job, he would die for Judy-his partner, his family.

Now, I understand the appeal of this resolution. There's a real philosophical tradition that sees personal love as the foundation of moral life, not a departure from it. And Nick learning to be vulnerable with someone, to commit to another person after years of isolation-that is growth. The movie earns those emotional beats.

But I wonder if it stops one step short.

The best stories about duty and service show characters extending their circle of care outward-learning that the love they have for one person can teach them to love more broadly. Nick's arc suggests the opposite: that personal attachment is where moral obligation ends rather than where it begins.

Consider what the film is saying to its young audience: a police officer's highest loyalty should be to the people they personally love, not to the community they've sworn to protect. In isolation, that's a reasonable human sentiment. But as a lesson-especially in a story about public service-it risks endorsing a kind of selective loyalty that, scaled up, looks more like tribalism than heroism.

I don't think the filmmakers intended this reading. And maybe I'm asking too much of a kids' movie. But the original Zootopia aimed high with its themes about prejudice and didn't flinch. This sequel sets up an equally ambitious question about sacrifice and civic duty, then settles for an easier answer.

Zootopia 2 promised a story about becoming a hero. It delivered a story about becoming a devoted friend. That's not nothing-but it's also not quite what it could have been.",0,0,0.18715225563909774,0.9983,4
rw10999177,cheezbqlls,9.0,2025-12-04,What a bunntastic movie,"When I first watched Zootopia as a child, I was captivated by its vibrant color palette, inventive character design, sharp humor, and fluid animation. Revisiting the franchise years later with Zootopia 2, I carried high expectations shaped by nostalgia and maturity. Although the work of Jared Bush and Byron Howard not only met those expectations but surpassed them in ways that couldn't satisfy me more watching a movie.

The film continues the journey of Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde, now as detectives, and their dynamic remains one of its best. Their opposite personalities, Judy's boundless optimism against Nick's carelessness (unless it's about her) create a compelling partnership that is perfectly matched.

One of the aspects I admire most is the insane attention to detail. Judy's ears alone, reacting to emotionals as fear, empathy, anger, concentration and reflecting the animators deep understanding of body language. Each character model is rendered with remarkable precision as individual hair strands, eyelashes, claws, and textures all demonstrate a level of art that speaks to genuine passion. The variety of outfits and environments showcases a love, further by thoughtfully matched sound design and finely tuned lighting and color work. The voice cast fits perfectly aligned with their characters, and the humor remains as fun and for all ages as the original film.

The movie succeeds in illustrating that differences between individuals do not necessarily deny their compatibility but rather they can strengthen bonds and inspire growth. The narrative reinforces the importance of fighting for those we care about, a message both beautiful and teaching for generations. I truly hope Disney continues embracing stories with this kind of emotional depth.

The only reason I won't give the film a full 10/10 is that it left me wanting more but personally I would have enjoyed the development of some kind of romantic story, even if unrealistic. After all, animation has always had the freedom to imagine the impossible.

Overall, Zootopia 2 gives me faith in Disney's ability to create meaningful, visually stunning, and timeless movies. I look forward to seeing how they continue to evolve this beloved world.",0,0,0.23523809523809522,0.999,0

rw10995811,zanderhorn,2.0,2025-12-02,What a horrible sequel,"Almost every aspect of this movie is horrible.

The pacing was atrocious, as with many modern movies. The beginning was very fast paced, not leaving any room to breath. The middle was better, but nothing to save my opinion on it. The end was still somewhat fast, with an uninteresting and horribly written apology from the main characters that wouldn't stop.

The writing itself was bad, being much worse than marvel in terms of quips. The references to the first movie were rampant in the first part of the movie, until they ran out of things to include. Which means it milked out every memorable action from the first movie, even slight character reactions to something in the world. For instance, Chief Bogo has the same reaction to tiny food as nick did in the first movie. The Raymond and Kevin scene was just replicated, with nothing funny added. The movie references were ok, with some being too on the nose and others were pretty interesting. The best reference was the shining bit near the end of the movie.

The plot itself was of course bad, which I was expecting and was hoping would be the only issue with the movie. What caused EVERY reptile to leave the city? Why was the conclusion that every reptile was bad when it was a reptile on reptile murder? The issue is that this isn't some complex characterization of reptiles and mammals, it's a cut and dry ""this side is bad and we kicked them out"". Even the first movie didn't have such a simple minded view on predators and prey. Not even bringing that up in the first movie just makes the movie seem extremely prejudiced, like the whole concept just purposely excludes a group of people while everyone knows it.

Character development, while including the quality of writing in the review, was very direct and vocal while still sounding like a millennial writing a relationship. Nick constantly brought up his childhood directly when it wasn't even mentioned or implied. Now once is ok, but when you do this multiple times so the viewer knows why, it's just poor writing. Just comparing the scene of nick talking about his childhood to Judy in the first movie on the tram, and any scene in the second movie other than when Judy's pen broke, should immediately show what i'm talking about.

While i could pick apart the entire movie, that would take a very long time. I've secretly wanted to do the same with the Five night's at Freddy's movie, but realistically there isn't a big enough audience for that amount of work. Anyway's just know that any ""its for kids"" comment can be immediately disproven by how good the first movie and any other ""good"" kids movie were.",1,3,0.029022988505747135,-0.9694,2

In terms of the characters, Judy wants to prove that she and Nick are the best partners, yet she consistently overlooks her own partner. Nick believes Judy should prioritize her, but he fails to express this clearly. While the overall storyline flows smoothly, it feels rushed, with all characters behaving like NPCs triggering plot points. The conflict between Judy and Nick stems from their differing values, yet when they open up to communicate, they never address this. Shouldn't Judy express gratitude to Nick and apologize for neglecting her partner? Shouldn't Nick apologize to Judy for his nonchalant and cynical attitude? However, the film lacks such reflection and understanding, focusing instead on confessing their psychological traumas to each other. The key issue is that attributing the harm they caused each other entirely to insecurity and anxiety is a way to avoid the problem, not a solution. The entire movie should have built Judy and Nick's characters around discovering, understanding, and resolving their differences. The character development should have culminated in them becoming the best partners precisely because they care about each other and are willing to acknowledge their own flaws and understand each other's concerns, rather than reducing the problem to one being insecure and the other anxious, which does little to foster their growth.

In terms of the plot, it can only be described as formulaic-it doesn't hold up under close scrutiny, as many logical inconsistencies become apparent. For example, why would Gary assume Bobbert would help him? What if it was a trap? And why would Judy, who doesn't know Gary, trust him so readily upon their first meeting? And so on.

In conclusion, this film works as a light and relaxing watch, but if you're here specifically for Judy and Nick, it's best to temper your expectations.",2,5,0.10822649572649572,-0.9448,2

The sequel performs quite well, but it didn't significantly exceed the expectations I set when purchasing my ticket two weeks in advance. My deepest sympathies to those who couldn't see it!

Character Development (B+)

The good news is that the core characters, Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde, remain true to their established selves. The new additions are passable, though online consensus about them being somewhat flat is accurate. The main issue lies with these new faces: one (Gary) has a simplistic but understandable motivation, and the other (Nibbles) is a good-natured character seemingly without any clear motivation at all.

Judy and Nick's depth largely rests on the foundation of the first film; viewed in isolation, the sequel doesn't fully capture their richness. I believe the film suffers from having too many characters. Combining the arcs of the beaver Nibbles Maplestick and the civet Gary might have resulted in a more complete central supporting role. As for the rest of the ensemble, they mainly serve as comedic filler-a style I personally enjoy as it gives a sense of continuity and connection to the broader Zootopia world.

Plot & Pacing (C+)

The plot certainly feels rushed at points. There's a definite sense of over-padding in the setup, with the main resolution crammed into the final twenty minutes. It's hard not to suspect the lengthy buildup contains ideas the writers loved but couldn't bear to cut, or perhaps was simply an excuse for Disney to showcase its dazzling animation capabilities.

The primary storyline is largely sound, except for one segment where the fast development felt solely designed to highlight Judy's individual skill. The real flaws are in the subplots and dropped threads, such as: What was the deal with Mayor Winddancer? Was he truly dealt with? And was the Pig Officer who fired the final shot truly compromised?

Tone & Theme (The Major Flaw) (C-)

This is where the sequel truly falters. The tone is excessively humorous, losing the undercurrent of subdued despair and existential melancholy that permeated the first film. The original's subtle darkness was essential; it was what made Judy's spirit and her optimistic drive to break down stereotypes and combat societal prejudice so valuable. It showcased a small figure fighting against the tide and rebelling against her destiny.

In this film, Judy often feels like she's creating trouble unnecessarily, as many complications could have been avoided. It positions itself as a police story but strips away the essence of police work, portraying its two officer protagonists and the entire ZPD as clueless buffoons largely irrelevant to the plot's core. The sequel devolves into a pure adventure story, losing all thematic depth.

If this script were for a film like The Bad Guys 2, it would be a perfect fit. But for a Zootopia film, I believe it falls short of the mark.

A Final Note on Romance (A+)

While the visuals didn't feel like a noticeable upgrade and occasionally bordered on visual fatigue, the emotional payoff was excellent. Compared to the ""space kiss"" in The Bad Guys 2, the subtle, mutual need and care between Judy and Nick-only explicitly stated at the very end-is far more exhilarating. I absolutely adore this kind of emotional development. Give me more!

It's sad how millions of people don't notice the subtle messages being implanted in our children's minds. G... parades, animals dressed in pink... Wake up - it's heartbreaking what animation has turned into nowadays.

For me, that was enough. My child will no longer watch any new movies that come out. I am tired and disgusted by the constant introduction of these messages everywhere. Wake up, please.""**",3,15,-0.21632996632996632,-0.9349,4

The plot was a bit disappointing though. Basically the same one as its predecessor isn't it? One big conspiracy, them making a mess but solving it in the end. It was not bad. And I wonder why they chose to put festival scenes? Those singer and dancers don't really help the story progression.

So overall, it was not bad but it could've been better.",0,1,0.16763392857142853,0.9179,0

This movie just like the first fails at a twist villain, The second villain not the first . Yes theirs two. Fails to live up to the hype. When the stakes are high they don't last for long and ultimately don't feel fully thought out. All in all it should have been way better. The first 3/4 feels like it was made to sell tickets and the last 1/4 feels like a half thought out story. Just wait for it to come to Disney+ it's not worth paying for.

Previous sequels, for example, Moana 2 were very forgettable for me. Zootopia 2 however, was a wonderful surprise to me! I felt like I was watching the original movie for the first time again. Great nods to the first movie, while still feeling fresh. Suspenseful, exciting, funny, heartwarming, charming, and even emotional, this was a very pleasant movie!",0,0,0.25438596491228066,0.9888,0
rw10997421,LenniKalleL,9.0,2025-12-03,Best sequel Disney has ever put out,"Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde are back in action after 9 years in a sequel to the blockbuster movie Zootopia from 2016! This time we'll hop on an adventure in which our beloved bunny-fox duo gets dragged onto a conspiracy that has its roots in the foundation of Zootopia around 100 or so years ago. They face challenges as they try to unravel the mysteries of the past and bring justice to those who have been wronged. New jolly-bunch of funny characters are met in the film and there is a lot of physical and verbal humour and clever dialogue that keeps the whole family entertained throughout the film.

The visuals and the animation are spectacularly well made and the cast and music is amazing. The chemistry between the characters is magnificently well written, especially Judy's and Nick's, as is the plot. Pop-culture references fit in successfully and no side character is overused to the point of annoyance. Some characters should have been developed further but otherwise nothing will feel out of place and everything clicks into place. Despite the film not bringing anything new or unique to the table, satisfaction is guaranteed and one may step out of the theater with a heart aflutter full of hopes and dreams.

Honestly speaking, I haven't had this much genuine fun or felt this good in a long time when going in and out of movies. Zootopia 2 is not a perfect movie but it was a sequel worth waiting for. Disney has a bad reputation with its sequels but they definitely cooked with this one. It's a certified banger movie and a modern (to be) classic.

Anyways, go see Zootopia 2 in theaters if you haven't already. It's definitely worth seeing and arguably better than its predecessor. I give it a solid 9/10.",0,0,0.23106060606060605,0.9925,4
